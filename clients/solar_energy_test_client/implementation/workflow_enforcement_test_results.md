# Workflow Enforcement Test Results
**Test Date**: 09/09/2025
**Test Scenario**: "Create a blog post about solar energy benefits for Australian homeowners"
**Test Objective**: Verify mandatory research workflow enforcement

## 🎯 TEST RESULTS SUMMARY

### ✅ **WORKFLOW ENFORCEMENT: SUCCESSFUL**

The mandatory research workflow enforcement is **WORKING CORRECTLY**. The system properly:

1. **BLOCKED content creation** until all research phases were completed
2. **ENFORCED phase dependencies** - each phase required previous phases to be complete
3. **MAINTAINED quality standards** throughout the research process
4. **FOLLOWED CLAUDE.md standards** for folder structure and file organisation
5. **INTEGRATED task_deps.md** with mandatory research phases and feedback loops
