## Executive Summary

Weight loss injectables represent a significant advancement in obesity management, with strong clinical evidence supporting their effectiveness. For Precision Upper GI Surgery, these medications offer an opportunity to position the practice as a comprehensive weight management centre that bridges non-surgical and surgical treatments.

### Key Research Findings:
- **Effectiveness**: Weight loss injectables achieve 10-23% total body weight reduction
- **Market Access**: Limited PBS coverage creates cost barriers for patients
- **Integration Opportunity**: Strong evidence for combining injectables with surgical approaches
- **Competitive Advantage**: Few upper GI practices comprehensively address both options
- **Patient Demand**: High demand with supply shortages indicating market opportunity
