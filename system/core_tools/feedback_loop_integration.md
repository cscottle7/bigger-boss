# Iterative Feedback Loop Integration Strategy

## PROBLEM IDENTIFIED
Current workflow uses **linear QA** instead of **iterative feedback loops**:
- Content Creation → Single QA Review → Final Delivery ❌
- Should be: Content Creation → Multi-Agent Feedback Loop → Iterative Refinement → Final Delivery ✅

## NEW ITERATIVE WORKFLOW ARCHITECTURE

### Phase 1: Content Creation
```yaml
content_generator:
  - Creates initial content draft
  - Follows brief specifications
  - Implements Answer First methodology
  - Triggers: clarity_conciseness_editor
```

### Phase 2: Multi-Agent Feedback Loop (ITERATIVE)
```yaml
clarity_conciseness_editor:
  - Reviews: Grammar, flow, readability, conciseness
  - Scoring: 1-10 scale with 8+ to proceed
  - If score < 8: Triggers content_refiner → Loop back to self
  - If score ≥ 8: Triggers cognitive_load_minimizer

cognitive_load_minimizer:
  - Reviews: Cognitive complexity, ease of understanding
  - Scoring: 1-10 scale with 7+ to proceed  
  - If score < 7: Triggers content_refiner → Loop back to clarity_conciseness_editor
  - If score ≥ 7: Triggers content_critique_specialist

content_critique_specialist:
  - Reviews: Argument strength, logical gaps, assumptions
  - Scoring: 1-10 scale with 7+ to proceed
  - If score < 7: Triggers content_refiner → Loop back to cognitive_load_minimizer
  - If score ≥ 7: Triggers ai_text_naturalizer

ai_text_naturalizer:
  - Reviews: Natural language flow, AI artifact removal
  - Scoring: 1-10 scale with 8+ to proceed
  - If score < 8: Triggers content_refiner → Loop back to content_critique_specialist
  - If score ≥ 8: Triggers enhanced_content_auditor
```

### Phase 3: Quality Gate Management
```yaml
enhanced_content_auditor:
  - Final comprehensive 4-perspective review
  - Aggregate scoring across all dimensions
  - If overall score < 8.5: Loop back to Phase 2
  - If overall score ≥ 8.5: Triggers content_finaliser
```

## INTEGRATION WITH EXISTING AGENTS

### Modified quality_gate_orchestrator
```yaml
Purpose: Manage iterative loop cycles and prevent infinite loops
New Functions:
  - Track iteration count (max 3 cycles)
  - Monitor score improvements between cycles
  - Escalate to human if no improvement after 2 cycles
  - Coordinate multi-agent feedback sequence
```

### Enhanced content_refiner
```yaml
Purpose: Apply specific feedback from reviewing agents
New Functions:
  - Accept targeted feedback from each reviewing agent
  - Apply changes systematically without losing prior improvements
  - Maintain version history of iterations
  - Return control to triggering agent for re-review
```

## QUALITY SCORING SYSTEM

### Agent Scoring Criteria
```yaml
clarity_conciseness_editor:
  - Grammar & spelling: 2 points
  - Sentence structure: 2 points  
  - Flow & transitions: 3 points
  - Conciseness: 3 points
  Total: 10 points

cognitive_load_minimizer:
  - Information hierarchy: 2 points
  - Cognitive complexity: 3 points
  - Scan-ability: 2 points
  - Mental processing ease: 3 points
  Total: 10 points

content_critique_specialist:
  - Argument strength: 3 points
  - Logical consistency: 2 points
  - Evidence support: 2 points
  - Assumption clarity: 3 points
  Total: 10 points

ai_text_naturalizer:
  - Natural language flow: 3 points
  - Human-like expression: 3 points
  - AI artifact removal: 2 points
  - Conversational tone: 2 points
  Total: 10 points
```

## LOOP TERMINATION CONDITIONS

### Success Termination
- All agents score ≥ threshold
- enhanced_content_auditor gives overall ≥ 8.5
- Content proceeds to content_finaliser

### Safety Termination
- Maximum 3 iteration cycles reached
- No score improvement in consecutive cycles
- Human escalation triggered
- Emergency override by quality_gate_orchestrator

## IMPLEMENTATION STEPS

1. Create 4 new feedback loop agents
2. Modify quality_gate_orchestrator for iteration management  
3. Enhance content_refiner with targeted improvement capabilities
4. Update task_deps.md files to include iterative loops
5. Add scoring thresholds to all reviewing agents
6. Test feedback loop with sample content

This ensures every piece of content goes through comprehensive, iterative improvement before final delivery.
