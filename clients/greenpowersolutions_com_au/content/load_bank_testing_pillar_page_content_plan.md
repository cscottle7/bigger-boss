### FAQ Section (500 words)
**H2:** "Frequently Asked Questions"

#### How often should generators be load tested for optimal performance?
AS/NZS 3010:2017 mandates monthly testing at 30% load capacity for standby generators, with annual 100% load testing for critical applications. Data centres require quarterly testing, mining operations need monthly validation, and construction sites benefit from commissioning plus periodic testing throughout project duration.

#### What's the difference between resistive and reactive load testing?
Resistive load testing validates basic power generation capacity under pure resistive loads, measuring voltage regulation and frequency stability. Reactive load testing evaluates power quality under real-world conditions including capacitive and inductive loads, harmonic analysis, and power factor testing from 0.8 lagging to 0.8 leading.

#### Can load bank testing be performed without shutting down operations?
Yes - we specialize in live testing procedures using hot-swap methodologies that maintain operational continuity. Our redundant system testing validates N+1 configurations, automatic transfer switch operation, and UPS integration without disrupting critical infrastructure operations.

#### What comprehensive documentation is provided after load bank testing?
Complete testing packages include detailed test certificates with performance analysis, AS/NZS 3010:2017 compliance documentation, power quality analysis reports, performance trending data, maintenance scheduling recommendations, and optimization insights for improved system efficiency.

#### How quickly can emergency load bank testing be deployed across Australia?
We provide 24/7 emergency response with 4-6 hour deployment across Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan areas, 8-12 hours for regional Australia. Mobile load bank units from 500kW to 2MW capacity ensure rapid testing capability for urgent commissioning or failure investigation requirements.

#### What testing capabilities do you provide for data centre Tier certification?
