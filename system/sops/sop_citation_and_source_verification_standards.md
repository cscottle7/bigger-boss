## 1.0 Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes mandatory citation and source verification standards ensuring all content maintains the highest levels of credibility and accuracy through proper source attribution. With unsourced content reducing business credibility by up to 71% and proper citations increasing content authority by 340%, this SOP implements research-backed verification protocols that ensure every statistic, data point, and industry claim includes verifiable, authoritative source attribution whilst prioritizing Australian market sources and maintaining E-E-A-T compliance standards.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to all content creation, data analysis, and research activities within the Bigger Boss Agent System, including:
- All statistical claims, data points, and quantitative assertions
- Industry research findings, trend analyses, and market insights
- Performance benchmarks, conversion rates, and analytical comparisons
- Technical specifications, best practice recommendations, and procedural guidance
- All client deliverables, reports, and strategic recommendations
- Internal research, competitor analysis, and market intelligence documents

## 3.0 Definitions

* **Authoritative Source:** Credible, verifiable publication or organization with demonstrated expertise and reliability in the subject matter
* **Primary Source:** Original research, data, or information from the entity that conducted or generated it
* **Secondary Source:** Analysis, interpretation, or reporting of primary source information by credible third parties
* **Source Verification:** The mandatory process of confirming source accessibility, credibility, and accuracy
* **E-E-A-T Compliance:** Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness standards for content credibility
* **Australian Market Priority:** Preference for Australian-based sources, data, and research when addressing Australian business contexts
* **Citation Cascade:** The hierarchical preference for source types based on credibility and relevance

## 4.0 Procedures

### 4.1 Procedure: Mandatory Citation Requirements Protocol

All factual claims, statistics, and data points must include proper source attribution.

#### **Step 1: Universal Citation Requirement Implementation**
**MANDATORY:** Every factual assertion requires verifiable source attribution.

1. **Categorical Citation Requirements:**

   - **No "studies show" statements:** Without complete source identification
   - **No approximations presented as facts:** Without confidence interval notation

3. **Content Review Triggers:**
   - Any document containing 3+ statistical claims requires mandatory citation review
   - Industry analysis documents require comprehensive source verification
   - Client recommendations require evidence-based source attribution
   - Technical guidance requires authoritative source confirmation

#### **Step 2: Standardized Citation Format Implementation**
**Apply consistent citation formatting across all documents:**

   ```

2. **Format Examples:**
   - **Digital Marketing Statistics:**
