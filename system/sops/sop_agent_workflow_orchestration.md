## 1.0 Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes comprehensive protocols for AI agent workflow orchestration within the Autonomous Agentic Marketing System. With multi-agent systems becoming essential for complex workflow automation and Microsoft, AWS, and other major platforms releasing sophisticated orchestration frameworks in 2024, this SOP implements research-backed orchestration patterns that coordinate specialised AI agents for efficient task completion while maintaining quality control and human oversight.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to all AI agent orchestration activities, including:
- Multi-agent workflow design and implementation
- Agent coordination and communication protocols
- Task distribution and resource management
- Quality control and error handling in agent workflows
- Human-agent collaboration and oversight processes
- Performance monitoring and orchestration optimisation

## 3.0 Definitions
