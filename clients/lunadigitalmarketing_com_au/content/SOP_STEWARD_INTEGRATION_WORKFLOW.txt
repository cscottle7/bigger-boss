#SOP Steward Integration Overview

##CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SOP Steward as Mandatory First Step
NEW WORKFLOW PROTOCOL:
- Phase 0: SOP Steward review BEFORE any content creation begins
- Compliance Check: Verify against existing brand and content standards
- Gap Analysis: Identify deviations from established SOPs
- Framework Application: Apply SOP-compliant structure to all content
- Copywriter Briefing: Ensure SOP knowledge before content creation

##SOP Steward Role Definition
Primary Responsibilities:
1. Pre-Content Review: Audit brief against established SOPs
2. Compliance Verification: British English, Australian context, professional standards
3. Brand Consistency: Ensure alignment with Luna Digital brand guidelines
4. Quality Standards: Verify Answer First sections, character counts, source citations
5. Regulatory Compliance: AHPRA guidelines, professional services standards

#Content Audit Against Current SOPs

##MAJOR COMPLIANCE GAPS IDENTIFIED:

###1. Director Information Inconsistency
- Current Issue: Multiple references to "Sarah Matthews" instead of "Natasha Chandra"
- Files Affected: Meet Our Director page, About Us sections, author attributions
- Compliance Risk: Brand credibility and factual accuracy concerns
- SOP Violation: Factual accuracy and brand consistency requirements

###2. Unsubstantiated Claims Throughout Content
- Issue: Response time guarantees without supporting evidence
- Examples: "24-hour response guarantee", "immediate consultation availability"
- SOP Violation: All claims must have credible source citations
- Risk Level: High - potential false advertising implications

###3. Missing Answer First Sections
- Current State: Executive summaries instead of Answer First structure
- SOP Requirement: All pages must begin with direct answer to user query
- Compliance Gap: 100% of pages lack proper Answer First implementation
- Impact: SEO performance and user experience degradation

###4. Target Market Too Narrow
- Issue: Exclusive focus on "professional services only"
- Market Reality: Luna Digital serves broader business community
- SOP Requirement: Accurate representation of service capabilities
- Business Impact: Limiting lead generation and market positioning

###5. Character Count Assessment Missing
- Gap: No systematic character count verification in quality checks
- SOP Standard: Meta descriptions must be 155 characters, titles 60 characters
- Current Risk: SEO performance limitations and search result truncation
