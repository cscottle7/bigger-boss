## Methodology & Data Sources

### SEO Extraction Methodology
**Analysis Approach:**
1. **Manual Website Review**: Direct examination of HTML source code
2. **Page-by-Page Assessment**: Systematic evaluation of each major page
3. **Comparative Analysis**: Benchmarking against SEO best practices
4. **Technical Validation**: HTML structure and schema markup review

### Data Collection Methods
**Information Sources:**
- **Website Source Code**: Direct HTML analysis for meta tags, headers, content
- **URL Structure Review**: Navigation and page architecture assessment
- **Content Analysis**: Word count estimation and keyword density evaluation
- **Technical Elements**: Schema markup and structured data assessment

### Analysis Limitations
**Data Quality Considerations:**
- **Limited Page Access**: Analysis based on publicly available pages
- **Content Estimation**: Word counts and content depth estimated from brief analysis

### Self-Critique
**Assessment Limitations:**
