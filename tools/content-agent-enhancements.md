# Content Agent Enhancements Required

## Issue Identified
Based on analysis of the TEST_SYSTEM agents, while there is a comprehensive `sop_audience_style_guide_development.md` SOP available, the content creation agents are not explicitly referencing or implementing audience style guides in their workflows.

## Current Status
✅ **SOP Available**: `sop_audience_style_guide_development.md` exists with comprehensive methodology
❌ **Agent Integration**: Content agents not explicitly referencing audience style guide requirement  
❌ **Trend Monitoring**: No dedicated agent for niche trend analysis across Reddit, forums, YouTube

## Required Updates

### 1. Content Agent Enhancements
The following agents need explicit audience style guide requirements added:

**Priority 1 - Content Creation Agents:**
- `content_strategist.md` - Add audience style guide reference in Master Content Brief section
- `content_generator.md` - Add style guide validation in content creation process
- `content_director.md` - Add style guide compliance in editorial oversight
- `blog_ideation_specialist.md` - Add audience-aligned topic development

**Priority 2 - Supporting Agents:**
- `brand_strategy_researcher.md` - Add audience style guide development as output
- `content_auditor.md` - Add style guide compliance checking
- `content_reviewer.md` - Add audience style guide validation criteria

### 2. Missing Agent Creation Required

## Implementation Priority

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Update content agents to reference audience style guide SOP
2. **WEEK 1**: Create niche trend researcher agent
3. **WEEK 2**: Integrate trend insights into content strategy workflow
4. **WEEK 3**: Test and validate enhanced content creation process

## Expected Impact

This addresses the gap between having excellent SOPs and ensuring they're actively implemented in the agent workflows.
