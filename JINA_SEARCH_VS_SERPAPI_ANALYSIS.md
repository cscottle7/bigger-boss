## Current SerpAPI Use Case Analysis

**File**: `.claude/agents/master_orchestrator.md` (Lines 346-374)

**What We're Doing**:
```python
keywords = [
    "cosmetic dentist sydney",
    "teeth whitening sydney cbd",
    "smile makeover specialist",
    "porcelain veneers cost sydney"
]

# Fetching: Top 10 organic results per keyword
# Analyzing: Competitor positions, titles, descriptions
# Purpose: Competitive intelligence and keyword difficulty
```

**Key Question**: Do we need exact ranking positions (1-10) or just top content?

---

## Use Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Traditional SEO Competitive Analysis
**Need**: "Who ranks where for target keywords?"

**Best API**: **SerpAPI** ✅
- Shows exact positions
- 10+ results per keyword
- SERP features included
- Competitive landscape visible

**JINA Search**: ❌ Insufficient (only top 5, no positions)

---

### Scenario 2: Content Gap Analysis
**Need**: "What content are top competitors publishing?"

**Best API**: **JINA Search** ✅
- Full page content extraction
- Top 5 is sufficient
- Deeper content analysis
- Free/cheap

**SerpAPI**: ⚠️ Only gets snippets (not full content)

---

### Scenario 3: Keyword Research
**Need**: "Is this keyword too competitive?"

**Best API**: **SerpAPI** ✅
- See if big brands dominate top 10
- Check SERP feature saturation
- Analyze ranking difficulty

**JINA Search**: ❌ Insufficient data

---

### Scenario 4: Local SEO Analysis
**Need**: "Local business competitive landscape"

**Best API**: **SerpAPI** ✅
- Local pack results
- Location-specific rankings
- Google Business Profile data

**JINA Search**: ❌ No local data

---

## Cost Analysis - Real Numbers

### Current Usage (SerpAPI):
- **100 clients/month** × 5 keywords = 500 searches
- **Cost**: $5/month (well within $50/month plan)
- **Value**: Saves 200+ hours of manual SERP analysis

### Switching to JINA Search:
- **100 clients/month** × 5 keywords = 500 searches
- **Tokens**: ~500 searches × 10,000 tokens = 5M tokens
- **Cost**: $0.10/month (5M tokens × $0.02 per 1M)
- **Savings**: $4.90/month
- **Loss**: No ranking positions, no SERP features, only top 5 results

**Is $5/month worth the better data?** YES - absolutely.

---

## Hybrid Approach (BEST SOLUTION)

Use **both APIs** for complementary intelligence:

### Phase 2A: SerpAPI for Competitive Intelligence
```python
# Step 1: SerpAPI for ranking analysis
serpapi_result = asyncio.run(serpapi_integration.analyze_competitors(
    domain=client_domain,
    keywords=keywords,
    client_domain=client_domain
))

# Get: Positions, competitor URLs, SERP features
# Saved to: competitive_analysis_{timestamp}.json
```

### Phase 2B: JINA Search for Content Analysis
```python
# Step 2: JINA Search for top 5 competitor content extraction
from system.core_tools.api_integrations import jina_search_analyzer

# Extract top 5 competitor URLs from SerpAPI results
top_competitors = serpapi_result['top_5_urls']

# Use JINA to extract full content
jina_content = asyncio.run(jina_search_analyzer.extract_competitor_content(
    urls=top_competitors,
    client_domain=client_domain
))

# Get: Full page content, headings, structure
# Saved to: competitor_content_analysis_{timestamp}.json
```

**Combined Intelligence**:
- SerpAPI: "Who ranks where" (competitive positioning)
- JINA Search: "What content are they publishing" (content strategy)
- Total Cost: $5.10/month for 100 clients
- Complete competitive intelligence

        """Search web using s.jina.ai"""

    async def extract_competitor_content(self, urls: List[str]) -> Dict:
        """Extract full content from competitor URLs using r.jina.ai"""
