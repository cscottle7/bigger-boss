## Executive Summary

This comprehensive Phase 1 research establishes the strategic foundation for Dr Graeme Brown's content marketing and digital presence optimisation. As a highly qualified orthopaedic surgeon specialising in knee, shoulder, and hip conditions in Geelong, Victoria, Dr Brown operates in a competitive market with established multi-surgeon practices and individual specialists. This research identifies clear differentiation opportunities through patient-centric content, evidence-based education, and targeted local SEO strategies.

**Key Finding:** With 47.60% of orthopaedic patients now self-referring (rather than physician-referred), direct-to-patient digital marketing and educational content are critical for practice growth.
