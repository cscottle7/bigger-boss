    - New API integrations with Jina AI for content analysis and semantic search.
    - SerpAPI integration now includes a backup key for improved reliability.

- **New Content and Client Files:**
    - Added a large number of new client files and updated existing content for `lunadigitalmarketing_com_au` and `precisionuppergisurgery_com_au`.

- **Cleanup:**
    - Removed a significant number of outdated markdown files and reports.

- **Configuration:**
    - Updated `.claude/settings.local.json` with new tool permissions.
    - Added Jina AI and backup SerpAPI keys to the environment configuration.

This new workflow ensures higher quality content, better research, and more reliable execution.
