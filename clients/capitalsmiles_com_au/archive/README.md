# Capital Smiles Archive

**Archive Created:** 18 September 2025
**Purpose:** Archival storage for outdated or superseded content during orthodontic specialisation restructuring

## Archive Organisation

### General Dentistry Content (Superseded)
Files that focused on general dentistry rather than orthodontic specialisation have been archived here to maintain specialist focus on lingual orthodontics.

### Content Realignment Notes
- Original content was too broad for orthodontic specialist practice
- Restructured focus specifically on lingual orthodontics and invisible braces
- Maintained relevant orthodontic elements from original research

## Archive Policy
- Files remain accessible for reference
- Content may be adapted for orthodontic context if relevant
- Archive prevents content confusion during specialisation
