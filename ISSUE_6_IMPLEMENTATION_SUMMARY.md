# Issue 6: Word Count Compliance - Implementation Summary

**Date Added:** 2 October 2025
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Status:** Analysis Complete, Ready for Implementation

---

## Problem Statement

Blog posts are exceeding SOP word count guidelines specified in `SOP_2025_Content_Creation_Standards.md`. Specifically:

- **Blog 1 (Hiring First Employee):** 2,400 words (400 words over How-to Guide limit)
- **Blog 2 (Spring Selling Checklist):** 2,600 words (600 words over How-to Guide limit, 100 words over SEO-Focused limit)

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. No Word Count Enforcement in Content Briefs
Content briefs don't specify target word counts, leaving writers without clear constraints.

### 2. No Word Count Verification in Feedback Loop
None of the feedback loop agents check word count compliance against SOP standards.

### 3. Confusion Between Blog Post Types
The SOP provides three different word count ranges but no clear classification system:
- SEO-Focused: 1,500-2,500 words
- How-to Guides: 1,000-2,000 words
- News/Updates: 500-800 words

### 4. "More is Better" SEO Misconception
Content creators may deliberately exceed limits believing longer content ranks better.

### 5. No Automated Word Count Tool
No systematic tool to calculate, verify, and enforce word count limits.

## Solution Framework

### New SOP Created
**`system/sops/sop_blog_post_word_count_standards.md`**

Provides:
- **Blog Post Type Classification System** with decision tree
- **Hard Limits** (blocking thresholds):
  - SEO-Focused: 2,700 words
  - How-to Guides: 2,100 words
  - News/Updates: 850 words
- **Optimal Ranges** for maximum engagement:
  - SEO-Focused: 1,800-2,200 words
  - How-to Guides: 1,200-1,800 words
  - News/Updates: 600-750 words
- **Content Splitting Guidelines** for over-length content
- **Quality vs Quantity Balance** principles

### New Tool Created
**`system/core_tools/word_count_verifier.py`**

Functions:
- **`classify_blog_post_type()`** - Automatically classifies blog type from title and content
- **`calculate_word_count()`** - Accurate word count excluding metadata and formatting
- **`verify_word_count_compliance()`** - Comprehensive compliance report with blocking status
- **`suggest_content_splitting()`** - Intelligent content splitting recommendations

### Agent Updates

**`sop_compliance_verifier` Agent:**
- **NEW:** Word Count Compliance verification (Section 5)
- **Scoring System Updated:** 10 points → 12 points (added 2 points for word count)
- **Pass Threshold:** 9/10 → 10/12 (83%)
- **Blocking Rule:** Content exceeding hard limits automatically fails

**Content Brief Template Updated:**
- **NEW Section 0:** Blog Post Classification and Word Count Target
- Mandatory blog type selection
- Target word count specification
- Hard limit documentation
- Trimming strategy planning

---

## Implementation Impact

### Pre-Feedback Loop Integration
**New Step Added:** Word count verification before entering feedback loop

```bash
python system/core_tools/word_count_verifier.py "clients/{domain}/content/{file}.md"
```

**Blocking Criteria:**
- Word count exceeds hard limit → BLOCKED from feedback loop
- Must trim, split, or reclassify before proceeding

### Updated Workflow Sequence

```yaml
phase_4_pre_feedback_scan:
  - run_automated_artifact_scan
  - em_dash_detection_and_count
  - structural_compliance_check
  - word_count_verification (NEW)
  blocking_rules:
    - "Artifact count >5 requires immediate cleanup"
    - "Word count exceeds hard limit → BLOCKED"
```

## Remediation for Family Focus Legal Blog Posts

### Current Status Analysis

**Blog 1: Hiring First Employee**
- Current: 2,400 words
- Classification: How-to Guide → Exceeds hard limit (2,100 words)
- **Recommended Action:** Reclassify as "SEO-Focused Comprehensive Guide" + trim 200 words
- Target: 2,200 words (optimal SEO-Focused range)

**Blog 2: Spring Selling Checklist**
- Current: 2,600 words
- Classification: How-to Guide → Exceeds hard limit (2,100 words)
- **Recommended Action:** Reclassify as "SEO-Focused Comprehensive Guide" + trim 400 words
- Target: 2,200 words (optimal SEO-Focused range)

### Why Reclassification is Justified

Both posts demonstrate characteristics of SEO-Focused Comprehensive Guides:
- **Multiple main sections** (5-8 H2 headings) ✅
- **Detailed explanations** with extensive examples ✅
- **Extensive research and citations** ✅
- **Comprehensive coverage** of complex legal topics ✅
- **Target competitive keywords** requiring depth ✅

### Trimming Strategy

**Blog 1 (Remove 200 words):**
- Condense redundant award system explanations (50 words)
- Streamline contract element descriptions (75 words)
- Simplify super calculation examples (50 words)
- Tighten safety requirements list (25 words)

**Blog 2 (Remove 400 words):**
- Reduce repetitive title documents explanation (100 words)
- Consolidate disclosure examples (150 words)
- Condense auction vs private treaty comparison (100 words)
- Tighten settlement timeline description (50 words)
