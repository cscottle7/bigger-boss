## Frequently Asked Questions

### What size load bank do I need for my generator?
Load bank capacity should match your generator's rated output capacity for comprehensive full-load testing. A 100kVA generator requires a 100kW load bank for complete capacity validation and performance certification. For partial load testing requirements: 30kW load banks suit generators up to 100kVA for routine maintenance, 100kW units support generators up to 300kVA for capability testing, whilst 200kW+ load banks enable testing of large industrial generators up to 500kVA capacity. Our technical specialists provide load analysis and testing recommendations based on your specific generator configuration, maintenance requirements, and testing objectives.

### How often should generators be load tested?
Industry best practice establishes monthly testing at 30% rated load with quarterly full-load testing for standby generators. Critical infrastructure applications including data centres and healthcare facilities require monthly full-load testing. Emergency generators benefit from bi-weekly 50% load testing preventing wet stacking formation. Load testing frequency depends on operational duty cycle: infrequently used standby generators require more frequent testing, whilst regularly operated generators benefit from periodic full-capacity validation. Our systematic testing programmes include performance documentation, fuel consumption analysis, and maintenance scheduling ensuring optimal generator reliability and compliance with Australian Standards AS/NZS 3010:2017.

### Can load banks be used for different generator types?
Yes, our manually switchable resistive load banks are compatible with all generator types including diesel, petrol, gas, and biodiesel generators. Load banks provide pure resistive load testing independent of generator fuel type or technology, making them suitable for testing diesel standby generators, gas-powered industrial units, portable petrol generators, and sustainable biodiesel systems. Voltage compatibility extends from 240V single-phase portable generators to 415V three-phase industrial systems. Our load banks accommodate various generator configurations including single units, parallel systems, and complex industrial installations requiring precise load distribution testing.

### Do you provide on-site load bank testing services?
Yes, we provide comprehensive on-site load bank testing services including portable load bank delivery, professional installation and connection services, complete testing procedure execution, and detailed performance reporting. Our certified technicians conduct capability testing, reliability assessment, wet stacking prevention programmes, and commissioning testing for new generator installations. Services include load bank positioning and connection, systematic load testing protocols, performance data recording, compliance documentation, and complete testing reports meeting Australian Standards AS/NZS 3010:2017. Emergency testing services are available with priority response for critical facility generators requiring immediate performance validation.

### What safety features are included with load banks?
Comprehensive safety systems include overheat protection with automatic load disconnection, emergency stop controls accessible from all operating positions, safety interlocks preventing operation with open enclosures, and continuous temperature monitoring with digital displays. Advanced safety features include ground fault protection, arc fault detection, ventilation monitoring ensuring adequate cooling airflow, and remote emergency stop capability for large installations. Professional installation includes electrical safety certification, earthing system verification, and compliance with Australian Standards AS/NZS 3000:2018 electrical installation requirements. All operators receive safety training covering load bank operation, emergency procedures, and workplace electrical safety compliance.

### Are load banks suitable for workshop and field use?
Our comprehensive load bank portfolio includes lightweight portable units (15kW-30kW) ideal for workshop generator testing, medium-capacity mobile units (100kW) suitable for on-site field testing, and heavy-duty industrial models (200kW-500kW) designed for permanent installation or transported via truck for large-scale testing. Workshop models feature compact designs, single-person portability, and standard electrical connections. Field testing units include weather-resistant construction, transport-friendly configurations, and rapid setup capability. All models maintain testing accuracy and safety standards regardless of deployment location, ensuring consistent performance across workshop and field applications.
