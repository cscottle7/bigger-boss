### **Audience Communication & Style Guide**

To effectively engage these personas, all website content should adhere to the following style guide.

---

#### **Core Principle: From Clinical to Conversational**

Our goal is to translate complex medical information into a clear, reassuring, and empathetic conversation. The website should feel less like a medical textbook and more like a direct consultation with a trusted specialist.

---

#### **Tone of Voice**

The brand voice should consistently be:

* **Authoritative:** The content is confident, knowledgeable, and evidence-based. It demonstrates true expertise by citing credible sources and showcasing Dr. Nguyen's credentials and experience.  
* **Empathetic:** The language acknowledges and validates the patient's or parent's anxieties and concerns. It speaks to their emotional state before presenting the clinical facts.  
* **Reassuring:** The tone is calm and supportive. It aims to reduce fear by providing clarity, demystifying procedures, and setting realistic expectations for treatment and recovery.  
* **Clear:** The primary goal is to be understood. The content is straightforward, direct, and unambiguous.

---

#### **Language & Diction**

* **Use Plain English:** Avoid overly clinical jargon. When a medical term (e.g., "adenotonsillectomy") must be used, it should be immediately followed by a simple explanation (e.g., "the surgical removal of the tonsils and adenoids").  
* **Speak Directly to the Reader:** Use "you" and "your child" to create a personal connection and make the information directly relevant to the reader's situation.  
* **Prefer Active Voice:** Use active voice to make sentences clearer and more direct. For example, instead of "A diagnosis will be made by Dr. Nguyen," write "Dr. Nguyen will diagnose your condition."  
* **Focus on Benefits & Outcomes:** Frame information around the positive outcomes for the patient. For example, instead of just describing a procedure, explain how it improves the child's breathing, sleep, and daytime behaviour.

#### **Formatting for Readability & AIO**

How the content is structured is as important as the words used.

* **Short Sentences & Paragraphs:** Break up complex ideas into short, digestible sentences. Keep paragraphs to a maximum of 3-4 lines to improve readability on all devices.  
* **Use Question-Based Headings:** Structure content with clear, descriptive H2 and H3 headings phrased as questions (e.g., "What Are the Symptoms of Chronic Sinusitis?"). This helps both users and AI systems quickly find specific answers.  
* **Use Lists and Bold Text:** Employ bullet points or numbered lists to break up text and make key information scannable.  
   **Bold** key terms and phrases to draw the reader's attention to important concepts.

---

#### **E-E-A-T Signal Integration**

Stylistically integrate trust signals throughout the content as outlined in the strategic blueprint.

* 'Dr. Nguyen's Expert Take':  
   Use visually distinct quote boxes to insert Dr. Nguyenâ€™s personal clinical insights, humanising his expertise.  
* **Anonymised Patient Stories:** Weave in short, relevant patient scenarios to illustrate the real-world impact of treatments and build an emotional connection.  
* **Clear Authorship:** Every educational page must be clearly authored by "Dr. Thomas Nguyen," with his credentials prominently displayed.
