## 1.0 Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes comprehensive protocols for identifying and eliminating AI writing artifacts to ensure all content reads naturally, authentically, and professionally for human audiences. This SOP strengthens existing content humanization workflows by providing systematic detection frameworks and elimination strategies specifically targeting AI-generated content patterns.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to:
- **INTEGRATION WITH DWS-SOP-QUALITY-001**: Enhances existing anti-hallucination protocols with artifact-specific detection
- All content creation agents and human writers
- The `ai_text_naturalizer` agent within the iterative feedback loop system
- Content reviewers and quality assurance specialists
- All written content intended for Australian business audiences
- Integration with existing `sop_content_substance_and_humanisation.md` protocols

## 3.0 Integration Requirements

### 3.1 Mandatory Integration Points
This SOP must integrate with:
- **Existing Feedback Loop System**: Enhances `ai_text_naturalizer` agent capabilities (threshold: 8/10)
- **Content Substance SOP**: Builds upon `sop_content_substance_and_humanisation.md` section 3.3
- **Quality Gate Orchestrator**: Implements systematic artifact detection protocols
- **Content Refiner Agent**: Provides specific artifact elimination feedback

### 3.2 Enhanced Agent Capabilities
The `ai_text_naturalizer` agent scoring criteria expands to include:
- **AI Artifact Detection**: 2 points (systematic pattern identification)
- **Natural Language Flow**: 3 points (existing - conversational rhythm)
- **Human Expression Enhancement**: 3 points (existing - personality injection)

## 4.0 AI Writing Artifacts Detection Framework

### 4.1 Category 1: Structural Artifacts

#### 4.1.1 Heading Pattern Artifacts
**Detection Criteria:**
- [ ] Excessive colon usage in headings ("Marketing Strategy: A Complete Guide")
- [ ] Formulaic "Ultimate Guide to X" patterns
- [ ] Over-structured content with unnecessary subheadings
- [ ] Numeric obsession (forcing content into "5 Ways" format)

**Elimination Protocol:**
```yaml
artifact_type: heading_pattern
detection_method: regex_pattern_matching
elimination_strategy: natural_heading_alternatives
scoring_impact: -0.5_points_per_occurrence
```

**Examples:**
- **❌ AI Pattern**: "Content Marketing: Your Complete Guide to Success"
- **✅ Human Alternative**: "Complete Content Marketing Guide" or "Everything You Need to Know About Content Marketing"

#### 4.1.2 List Structure Artifacts
**Detection Criteria:**
- [ ] Everything forced into numbered or bulleted lists
- [ ] Artificial list creation where narrative flow would be better
- [ ] Excessive subdivision of simple concepts
- [ ] Lists used to inflate content length

**Elimination Strategy:**
- Convert unnecessary lists to natural paragraph flow
- Retain lists only where they genuinely aid comprehension
- Vary content structure throughout document

### 4.2 Category 2: Language Pattern Artifacts

#### 4.2.1 Transition Word Overuse
**High-Risk AI Transitions:**
- "Furthermore" (appearing at paragraph starts)
- "Additionally" (overused connector)
- "Moreover" (academic tone excess)
- "Subsequently" (robotic sequencing)
- "In conclusion" (formulaic endings)

**Natural Alternatives Framework:**
```yaml
robotic_transition: "Furthermore, it's important to consider..."
natural_alternative: "You should also think about..." or "Another key point is..."
personality_injection: "Here's what else matters:" or "Don't forget about..."
```

#### 4.2.2 Corporate Speak Detection
**Immediate Red Flags:**
- "Leverage" (when "use" works better)
- "Utilize" (when "use" is clearer)
- "Implement solutions" (generic business speak)
- "Best practices" (overused terminology)
- "Optimize" (when "improve" is simpler)

**Elimination Protocol:**
1. **Scan Content** for corporate speak terms
2. **Replace with Plain English** equivalents
3. **Test Readability** with target audience vocabulary
4. **Verify Natural Flow** through read-aloud testing

### 4.3 Category 3: Syntactic Artifacts

#### 4.3.1 Em Dash Overuse Detection
**Pattern Recognition:**
- [ ] Em dashes appearing multiple times per paragraph
- [ ] Unnecessary parenthetical statements using em dashes
- [ ] Complex sentence structures that could be simplified

**Example Elimination:**
- **❌ AI Pattern**: "Content marketing—when done correctly—can transform your business—and your bottom line."
- **✅ Human Alternative**: "Good content marketing transforms your business and increases revenue."

#### 4.3.2 Hedge Language Excess
**Problematic Patterns:**
- "might potentially" (double hedging)
- "could possibly help to" (excessive uncertainty)
- "may tend to" (unnecessarily tentative)
- "it appears that it might" (confidence undermining)

**Confidence Enhancement Strategy:**
```python
def eliminate_hedge_language(content):
    confidence_replacements = {
        "might potentially": "can",
        "could possibly help to": "helps",
        "may tend to": "often",
        "it appears that it might": "it does"
    }
    return apply_confidence_transforms(content, confidence_replacements)
```

### 4.4 Category 4: Content Pattern Artifacts

#### 4.4.1 Generic Introduction Patterns
**AI Formula Detection:**
- [ ] Starting with dictionary definitions
- [ ] "In today's digital landscape..." openings
- [ ] Rhetorical questions as hooks
- [ ] "Have you ever wondered..." beginnings

**Human-Centric Alternatives:**
- Start with specific, relatable scenarios
- Use direct problem statements
- Begin with surprising statistics or insights
- Open with conversational observations

#### 4.4.2 Filler Phrase Elimination
**Systematic Removal Targets:**
- "It's important to note that"
- "It should be mentioned that"
- "It's worth pointing out that"
- "One should consider that"
- "It must be emphasized that"

**Replacement Strategy:**
Simply delete these phrases or replace with direct statements:
- **❌**: "It's important to note that E-E-A-T is not a direct ranking factor."
- **✅**: "E-E-A-T isn't a direct ranking factor." or "Here's a common misconception: E-E-A-T isn't a direct ranking factor."

## 5.0 Natural Language Enhancement Protocols

### 5.1 Conversational Flow Optimization

#### 5.1.1 Human Speech Pattern Integration
**Implementation Framework:**
```yaml
natural_elements:
  contractions: "don't, won't, can't, isn't" (use consistently)
  personal_pronouns: "you, your, we, our" (direct engagement)
  informal_connectors: "Plus, Also, And here's the thing"
  thought_completers: "Here's why:", "The bottom line:", "What this means:"
```

#### 5.1.2 Rhythm and Pacing Techniques
**Sentence Variation Strategy:**
- **Short impact sentences**: 3-5 words for emphasis
- **Medium explanatory sentences**: 8-15 words for main points
- **Longer descriptive sentences**: 16-25 words maximum for detail
- **Fragment usage**: For emphasis. Like this.

### 5.2 Personality Injection Without Losing Professionalism

#### 5.2.1 Australian English Context Adaptation
**Cultural Communication Preferences:**
- Direct, honest communication style
- Understated confidence (not American hyperbole)
- Practical, no-nonsense approach
- Friendly professionalism without excessive casualness

**Tone Calibration Examples:**
- **❌ American AI**: "This will absolutely revolutionize your business!"
- **✅ Australian Professional**: "This approach consistently delivers strong results for our clients."

#### 5.2.2 Voice Consistency Framework
**Brand Voice Integration:**
```yaml
helpful_expert_voice:
  characteristics: ["knowledgeable", "approachable", "practical"]
  language_patterns: ["Here's what works...", "In our experience...", "You'll find that..."]
  avoid_patterns: ["Obviously", "Clearly", "It's simple", "Just"]
```

## 6.0 Advanced Detection Methods

### 6.1 Automated Artifact Scanning

#### 6.1.1 Pattern Recognition Algorithms
**Systematic Scanning Protocol:**
```python
def comprehensive_artifact_scan(content):
    artifact_score = 0
    
    # Heading pattern analysis
    heading_artifacts = detect_heading_patterns(content)
    artifact_score += len(heading_artifacts) * 0.5
    
    # Language pattern detection
    transition_overuse = count_robotic_transitions(content)
    artifact_score += transition_overuse * 0.3
    
    # Structural analysis
    list_overuse = analyze_structure_patterns(content)
    artifact_score += list_overuse * 0.2
    
    # Filler phrase detection
    filler_count = detect_filler_phrases(content)
    artifact_score += filler_count * 0.4
    
    return calculate_naturalness_score(10 - artifact_score)
```

#### 6.1.2 Human Appeal Metrics
**Quantitative Assessment Criteria:**
- **Readability Score**: Flesch-Kincaid target 7th-9th grade level
- **Conversational Index**: Ratio of personal pronouns to total words
- **Sentence Variety**: Standard deviation of sentence lengths
- **Engagement Markers**: Questions, direct addresses, personality indicators

### 6.2 Manual Review Checkpoints

#### 6.2.1 Read-Aloud Testing Protocol
**Mandatory Verification Steps:**
1. **Natural Speech Test**: Does it sound like human conversation?
2. **Pace Evaluation**: Are there natural pauses and rhythm?
3. **Engagement Assessment**: Would you continue listening?
4. **Clarity Verification**: Is the meaning immediately clear?

#### 6.2.2 Human Relatability Audit
**Assessment Questions:**
- [ ] Would a real person say this in conversation?
- [ ] Does it solve a genuine problem the reader faces?
