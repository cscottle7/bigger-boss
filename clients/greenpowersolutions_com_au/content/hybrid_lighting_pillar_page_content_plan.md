### FAQ Section (400 words)
**H2:** "Frequently Asked Questions"

#### How does hybrid solar-diesel lighting achieve 90% fuel reduction?
Hybrid systems prioritise solar power during daylight hours, storing excess energy in high-capacity lithium batteries. Diesel backup only activates when battery levels drop below 20% or during extended cloudy periods, resulting in 90% fuel reduction compared to traditional diesel-only lighting systems.

#### How quickly does the system switch to diesel backup power?
Automatic switchover occurs within 2 seconds of solar power insufficiency through intelligent power management systems. This seamless transition ensures continuous lighting without interruption, maintaining 100% reliability for critical applications and events.

#### What happens during extended cloudy weather conditions?
Advanced lithium battery storage provides 48-72 hours autonomous operation without solar input. When batteries reach 20% capacity, the diesel generator automatically activates, providing unlimited extended runtime capability whilst maintaining whisper-quiet operation.

#### How quiet is the diesel backup operation for residential areas?
Our hybrid systems operate at 52dB during diesel mode - quieter than normal conversation and compliant with residential noise restrictions. This makes them ideal for events, construction sites near populated areas, and noise-sensitive environments.

#### Can these systems withstand severe Australian weather conditions?
All systems feature Cyclone Category 5 rating, IP65 dust and water protection, and -10°C to +55°C operating temperature range. Components undergo rigorous Australian Standards testing for extreme weather, UV resistance, and coastal salt air exposure.

#### What maintenance is required for hybrid lighting systems?
Maintenance includes annual solar panel cleaning, quarterly battery performance testing, and generator servicing per manufacturer schedule. Remote monitoring systems provide real-time performance alerts, enabling predictive maintenance and ensuring optimal system performance.
