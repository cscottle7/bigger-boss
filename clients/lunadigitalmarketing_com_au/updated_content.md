**Marketing That Respects Your Profession**

In a high-stakes professional environment, marketing isn't just about getting noticed. It's about growing your practice while upholding the standards your clients and industry expect.

* **You need to attract more clients,** but your industry has strict advertising rules and a code of conduct that can make marketing feel like a minefield.  
* **You want to build your reputation as an expert,** but every claim you make must be justifiable, accurate, and uphold the integrity of your profession.  
* **You need to stand out in a competitive market,** but generic tactics don't work. Your clients demand a higher level of trust and proof of expertise.

Luna Digital delivers compliant, performance-driven marketing for Australia's leading specialist firms. Led by Director **Natasha Chandra**, our team combines 20+ years of regulatory expertise with smart technology to grow your practice's revenue and reputation.

**The Specialist Advantage**

The key difference in our approach is specialisation. We focus exclusively on high-stakes, regulated industries, offering deep regulatory knowledge that general agencies simply cannot match.

**Deep Regulatory Knowledge**

We maintain current expertise in the complex codes of conduct, advertising guidelines, and privacy laws that govern professional industries across Australia.

**Industry-Specific Technology**

We use proprietary AI tools to conduct deep market research, analysing competitor strategies and identifying client acquisition opportunities with a level of detail that is humanly impossible. This is combined with technology that integrates with the specialist practice management systems you already use.

**A Proven Implementation Method**

From an initial compliance audit to strategy, implementation, and ongoing optimisation, our structured process removes uncertainty and ensures success.

**Marketing Engineered for the AI Revolution**

The way your clients find you has fundamentally changed. AI Overviews on Google and chatbots are now the starting point for millions of Australians, providing direct answers instead of just links.

Think of old search as a store directory. It gave you a long list of options.

AI search is a personal concierge. It listens to a client's specific problem and provides a single, trusted recommendation. Our goal is no longer just to get you on the list. It is to make your practice the single recommendation the concierge makes.

---

**How to Get Started**

We make beginning your growth journey straightforward and transparent. Here is what happens next.

1. **A Strategic Call** A direct discussion about your practice, your goals, and your compliance challenges.  
2. **A Comprehensive Audit** We conduct a detailed analysis of your current marketing activities and digital presence.  
3. **A Custom Strategy** You receive a personalised plan with a clear timeline and expected outcomes.

 

**The AI-Powered Tools We Use**

We don't just help you get found by AI, we use it to deliver better results. Our internal AI toolkit allows us to:

* **Gain Deeper Insights:** We analyse the market and your competitors with a level of detail that is humanly impossible, identifying opportunities others miss.  
* **Create Higher-Quality Content:** Our AI-assisted workflows help us produce highly relevant, "citation-worthy" content with greater precision and speed.  
* **Anticipate Future Demand:** We use predictive AI to forecast the questions your customers will be asking tomorrow, building content that establishes you as a thought leader and captures demand before it becomes competitive.

**Your Marketing Questions Answered**

**What makes you different from a general marketing agency?**

Our exclusive focus. We specialise in high-stakes, regulated industries. This means we have a deep, practical understanding of your compliance challenges and professional obligations, which is something generalist agencies cannot offer.

**How do you ensure marketing is compliant with AHPRA or Legal Conduct Rules?**

Compliance is the foundation of our entire process. Every piece of content and every campaign undergoes a multi-stage review against the relevant codes and advertising guidelines. Our process is designed to protect your reputation first.

**What kind of return on investment can we expect?**

We focus on metrics that matter to your practice, such as the cost to acquire a new client and the lifetime value of that client. While results vary, our strategies are designed to deliver a clear and measurable return on your investment over time.

**Do you only work with medical and legal clients?**

While medical and legal practices are our core clients due to their complex regulations, we also work with other specialist firms where trust and compliance are critical, including financial advisers, consultants, and engineers.

# **About Us \- Our Story & Mission Values**

**H1: An Agency Built from First-Hand Experience**

**The Luna Digital Story: Why We Understand the Pressures You Face**

Our story did not start in a boardroom with spreadsheets and projections. It started in the busy waiting rooms and back offices of the specialist practices we now serve.

Our director, Natasha Chandra, spent years working as a Practice Manager. She lived the daily reality of balancing exceptional patient care with the need for sustainable growth, all while navigating the immense pressure of regulatory compliance.

She saw a universal frustration. Generic marketing agencies would promise growth but had no real understanding of the risks. They did not grasp the weight of AHPRA's guidelines or the nuances of Legal Professional Conduct Rules. They offered tactics that ignored a fundamental truth of your world: **a reputation takes a lifetime to build and only a moment to destroy.**

Luna Digital was founded to fix that. We built it to be the marketing partner we knew specialist firms were looking for. A partner that speaks your language, respects your rules, and is built on a foundation of real-world, in-the-trenches experience.

 

---

**Our Commitments to You**

We built our entire agency around three promises. These are the non-negotiable standards that guide every decision we make and every strategy we implement.

**1\. Protect Your Reputation, Always**

Your professional integrity is your most valuable asset. That is why every action we take starts with one question: "Does this protect and enhance our client's reputation?" If the answer is no, we do not do it. Period. We have a zero-tolerance approach to regulatory risk.

**2\. Deliver a Measurable Return**

Marketing must deliver a clear, justifiable return on your investment. We focus on tangible outcomes, from improving the quality of client inquiries to increasing practice revenue. We track what matters and provide transparent reports that show you exactly how your investment is performing.

**3\. Work as a True Extension of Your Team**

We believe in partnership over profit. Our role is to work as an extension of your practice, supporting your long-term success through strategic planning, industry insights, and a shared commitment to your goals. We will be the first to tell you if a marketing channel is not the right fit for your practice.

 

---

**Our Values Are Our Promises**

These are the non-negotiable standards that guide every decision we make.

**1 Your Reputation is Everything**

We know that for a professional, a reputation is your most valuable asset. That is why every decision we make starts with a simple question. 'Does this protect and enhance our client's professional integrity?' If the answer is no, we do not do it. Period.

**2 Excellence Through Specialisation**

Our team's exclusive focus on professional industries means we understand your challenges, opportunities, and regulatory environment better than any generalist agency. We invest constantly in our education to stay ahead of changes in your field.

**3 Partnership Over Profit**

We work as an extension of your team. We understand your goals and values to deliver customised solutions. We believe in transparency, which means we will be the first to tell you if a marketing channel is not right for your practice.

---

**The Specialist Advantage**

The key difference in our approach is specialisation. Luna Digital is one of Australia's few agencies dedicated exclusively to high-stakes, regulated industries. This focus provides our clients with several key advantages.

**Deep Regulatory Knowledge**

Our team includes former practice managers and legal marketers. We do not just know marketing. We know your world. We maintain current expertise in the complex codes of conduct, advertising guidelines, and privacy laws that govern your profession.

**A Flawless Compliance Record**

In our years of operation, we pride ourselves on maintaining an impeccable compliance record for our clients. In a high-stakes environment, this peace of mind is invaluable.

**Industry Recognition**

Our expertise is recognised by professional bodies. We are also regular contributors to industry education on ethical and effective marketing. This authority ensures you are working with a true leader in the field.

We design and develop high-performing websites for businesses in regulated industries. Our websites are built to serve as your most powerful asset for building trust and attracting your ideal clients.

**Key Benefits**

* Enhance your professional credibility and authority online.  
* Attract a consistent stream of high-quality client inquiries.  
* Ensure full compliance with your industry's advertising guidelines (e.g., AHPRA, Legal Professional Conduct Rules).  
* Improve operational efficiency with integrated booking and client management systems.

**Perfect for:** Medical practices, legal firms, financial advisers, and consultants who need a website that is more than a brochure. It's a strategic tool for growth.

---

**Your Website Is Your Biggest Opportunity and Your Biggest Risk**

For any business, your website is the cornerstone of your reputation. It is often the first interaction a potential client has with your practice. A professional, user-friendly site can build instant credibility and attract high-value clients.

But in a regulated environment, it can also be your biggest compliance risk. A single poorly worded claim or a non-compliant testimonial can lead to professional conduct issues, damaging the reputation you have worked so hard to build. Generic web designers do not understand this pressure. They build sites that may look good but leave you exposed.

---

**Our Approach A Website Built on a Foundation of Compliance**

We solve both problems at once. Our entire web design process is built on a foundation of deep regulatory knowledge. We create websites that combine conversion-focused design with the authoritative presence your profession demands. The result is a digital platform that converts visitors into high-value clients while upholding the strictest industry standards.

**\[Book My Free Consultation\]**

 

---

**A Tailored Approach for Your Profession**

We do not use a one-size-fits-all template. We tailor our design and development process to meet the specific compliance needs and client expectations of your industry.

* **For Medical Practices**, we focus on patient-centric design that builds trust and makes booking appointments easy. We ensure every element, from service descriptions to practitioner bios, is fully compliant with AHPRA's strict advertising guidelines.  
* **For Legal Firms**, we create sites that project authority and expertise. The design and content adhere to the Legal Professional Conduct Rules that govern how you can present your services, successes, and solicitors.  
* **For Consultants and Accountants**, our approach is centred on building credibility and thought leadership. We create a platform that showcases your expertise, validates your authority, and attracts high-value B2B clients.

**Our Process and Timeline**

**Discovery Phase**

Our process begins when we sit down with you and your key team members to understand your practice from the inside out. We analyse your target clients, current marketing challenges, and growth objectives.

**Content and Research Phase**

With a clear understanding of your goals, we move into content strategy. We use our AI-powered tools to conduct deep market analysis, uncovering insights into your competitors and identifying content opportunities that others miss. This research informs your website's structure and the compelling, copy we create to form the foundation of the new design.

**Design and Development Phase**

Using these insights, we create custom designs that reflect your professional identity while optimising for client conversion. Our process includes mobile responsiveness, page speed optimisation, and secure setup.

**Testing and Launch Phase**

Before launch, we conduct comprehensive testing, verify all compliance elements, and perform security audits. Our typical timeline for a standard practice website is 8 weeks, with a detailed schedule provided in your project proposal.

---

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**What makes your approach different from a standard web agency?**

Our exclusive focus on professional services is our key difference. Unlike general agencies, we have deep, practical expertise in the regulatory and compliance challenges you face. We build websites that are not just visually appealing, but also protect your professional reputation.

**How do you ensure my website is compliant?**

Compliance is the foundation of our entire process. Our team has specific training in AHPRA guidelines and Legal Professional Conduct Rules. Every element of your site, from the design to the written content, undergoes a multi-stage compliance review before it goes live.

**My profession isn't medical or legal. Can you still help?**

Yes. While we use medical and legal as key examples due to their strict regulations, we work with a wide range of professionals including accountants, consultants, engineers, and architects. Our core skill is building websites for any profession where trust, credibility, and compliance are paramount.

**Do you provide training after the website is launched?**

Absolutely. Before we launch your new website, we provide comprehensive training for you and your staff. We ensure you are comfortable and confident in managing your new site and its features, so you can make updates easily.

**What do you need from me to get started on the project?**

The most important thing we need is your expertise. Our initial Discovery Phase involves a collaborative workshop where we learn about your practice, your goals, and your clients. After that, we simply need your team's feedback at key design milestones and help in gathering specific content for the site.

**Do I own the website and its content once the project is finished?**

Yes, absolutely. Once the project is complete and the final payment is made, you have one hundred percent ownership of the website and all its content. We provide you with full administrative access and the training you need to manage it effectively.

**Why shouldn't I just use a website builder like Wix or Squarespace?**

While those tools are useful for simple sites, they often lack the robust security and specific compliance features required by professional practices. Our service provides a custom-built, secure, and fully compliant digital asset that is strategically designed to attract high-value clients, not just to exist online.

**Do you provide ongoing support or maintenance after the site is launched?**

Yes, we offer a range of ongoing support and maintenance plans to keep your website secure, updated, and performing optimally. We see the launch as the beginning of our partnership, and we are here to support your practice's growth long term.

**The Professional's Social Media Dilemma**

For a professional in a regulated industry, social media can feel like a minefield. You know you need a presence to connect with clients and build your brand, but the risks are significant. One wrong post—however well-intentioned—can create a serious compliance headache and damage a reputation that took a lifetime to build.

Most professionals lack the time and specialist knowledge to navigate this complex environment effectively. They end up posting sporadically or avoiding social media altogether, missing a powerful opportunity to connect with their community and attract high-value clients.

---

**Our Approach A Strategy That is Both Safe and Effective**

We navigate that minefield for you. We believe social media for professionals is not about chasing viral trends. It is about strategically building trust and demonstrating expertise over time. Our approach focuses on creating high-value educational content and fostering professional community engagement that enhances your reputation without compromising the standards your industry demands.

**\[Book My Free Consultation\]**

---

**A Tailored Strategy for Your Profession**

Each professional field has different rules and opportunities on social media. We develop a unique, compliant strategy based on your specific industry and goals.

* **For Medical Practices**, our content focuses on health education and community leadership, all while carefully navigating AHPRA's strict advertising guidelines. We position you as a trusted healthcare resource without crossing therapeutic advertising lines.  
* **For Legal Firms**, we demonstrate expertise through educational content on legal topics. We adhere strictly to Legal Professional Conduct Rules to position your firm as a thought leader and attract high-value clients without inappropriate solicitation.  
* **For Consultants and Financial Advisers**, our strategies centre on building your personal brand and credibility. We use platforms like LinkedIn to share valuable insights, establish you as a thought leader, and attract B2B clients who are seeking a trusted, expert partner.

 

---

**The Benefits of Our Specialist Approach**

Our specialist approach to social media transforms it from a simple broadcast tool into a strategic platform for building trust, community, and your professional brand.

* **Build a Genuine Community and Trust** We go beyond just posting content. Our strategies are designed for professional engagement, allowing you to build a loyal community that trusts your expertise. In regulated industries, this trust is your most valuable currency.  
* **Actively Protect Your Professional Brand** A non-specialist can inadvertently damage your brand with a single non-compliant or off-tone post. Our compliance-first methodology ensures every post is designed to enhance your professional prestige and protect your hard-earned reputation.  
* **Gain Valuable Audience Insights** By monitoring conversations and engagement, we provide you with direct insights into the questions and concerns of your ideal clients. This feedback is invaluable and can inform service development, client communication, and other marketing efforts.

 

---

**Our Process for Compliant Growth**

Our structured process eliminates the guesswork and delivers consistent, professional results.

1. **Strategy & Compliance Framework** We start with a deep analysis of your practice, audience, and goals. We develop a content strategy and a clear compliance framework to ensure all activity is safe and effective.  
2. **Content Creation & Approval** Our team researches, writes, and designs all your social media content. We present a monthly content calendar for your review and approval, so you always have the final say before anything goes live.  
3. **Management & Reporting** We provide active daily management of your accounts, including posting, engaging with your community, and monitoring for any sensitive comments. We provide detailed monthly reports that show the real business impact of your social media presence.  
   ---

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How do you handle negative comments or sensitive client questions online?**

We have a strict protocol for this. Our team is trained to monitor all engagement and respond professionally. We never engage in public debates and aim to take sensitive conversations offline immediately, all while adhering to strict privacy and professional conduct rules.

**Which social media platforms are right for my practice?**

The right platform depends entirely on your goals. For many B22B professionals like consultants and lawyers, LinkedIn is a powerful tool for building authority. For health practices, platforms like Facebook can be effective for community education. We will provide a clear recommendation based on our initial strategy research.

**Will you create all the content, or do I have to provide it?**

We create all the content for you. Our process involves researching and designing all the posts based on the strategy we develop together. Your role is simply to provide your expert feedback and final approval.

**How do you measure the success of a social media campaign?**

We focus on metrics that matter to your practice, not vanity metrics like 'likes'. We measure success through the growth of your professional authority, including increased engagement on educational content and a measurable increase in high-quality inquiries to your practice.

**What happens if one of our staff posts something non-compliant?**

We help you prevent this by developing a clear social media policy and approval workflow for your practice. All content we create goes through a multi-stage compliance review, and we can provide guidance to ensure any content you post internally also meets these standards.

**How do you prove that social media is generating business?**

We focus on metrics that connect to your business goals. We track website clicks from your social profiles, direct inquiries that reference your social media presence, and growth in engagement on key educational topics that are known to attract your ideal clients.

**My work is confidential. What can we possibly post about?**

This is a common and important concern. Our content strategy never involves client specifics. Instead, we focus on sharing de-identified educational themes, explaining general concepts, commenting on public industry news, and highlighting your practice's professional development and community involvement.

We have a strict protocol for this. Our team is trained to monitor all engagement and respond professionally and promptly. We never engage in public debates and aim to take sensitive conversations offline immediately, all while adhering to strict privacy and professional conduct rules.

**How much of my time will this require from me each month?**

Our service is designed to be as efficient for you as possible. We require some of your time during the initial strategy phase. After that, we typically only need you to review and approve the content calendar each month, which is a very streamlined process.

**Will you create all the content, or do I have to provide it?**

We create all the content for you. Our process involves researching, writing, and designing all the posts based on the strategy we develop together. Your role is simply to provide your expert feedback and final approval on the content before it goes live.

**How do you measure the success of a social media campaign?**

We focus on metrics that matter to your practice, not vanity metrics like 'likes'. We measure success through the growth of your professional authority. This includes increased engagement on educational content, growth in your professional network, and a measurable increase in high-quality inquiries to your practice.

**Which social media platforms are actually right for my practice?**

The right platform depends entirely on your goals. For many B2B professionals like consultants and lawyers, LinkedIn is a powerful tool for building authority. For health practices, platforms like Facebook can be effective for community education. We will provide a clear recommendation based on our initial strategy research.

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**How is this different from just 'boosting' a post on Facebook?**

Boosting a post is like putting a flyer on a public notice board. Our paid advertising service is a strategic campaign. We use precise targeting, custom landing pages, and ongoing optimisation to ensure your budget is spent reaching only the most relevant people who are actively looking for your services.

**What kind of budget do I need to get started?**

The ideal budget varies based on your industry and goals. We work with you to establish a starting budget that is both comfortable for your practice and sufficient to generate meaningful data. Our focus is on delivering a strong return on investment at every budget level.

**Do you create the landing pages for the ads?**

Yes. Creating dedicated, high-converting, and compliant landing pages is a core part of our service. A great ad needs a great destination, and we ensure the entire user journey is seamless and designed to encourage consultation bookings.

**Can you guarantee results?**

While no agency can guarantee specific results, we can guarantee a transparent, expert-led process designed to minimise wasted ad spend. Our methodology is built to quickly identify the campaigns that deliver the best return for your practice.

**Will paid ads make my practice look desperate or "salesy"?**

No. Our approach is the opposite. We design campaigns that are professional, educational, and tasteful. The goal is to position you as a helpful authority and a valuable resource, which enhances your brand's prestige rather than cheapening it.

**How do you handle audience targeting and data privacy?**

We adhere strictly to Australia's Privacy Act and the ethical guidelines of each platform. Our targeting focuses on professional demographics, legitimate interests, and user intent, never on sensitive personal health or legal information.

**What platforms do you recommend besides LinkedIn and Facebook?**

Our strategy is platform-agnostic. We place your ads where your ideal clients spend their time. While LinkedIn is often key for B2B professionals, we may also recommend targeted campaigns on platforms like Google's display network or industry-specific forums where appropriate.

**The Frustration of Being Invisible Online**

Every day, potential clients search Google for the exact services you offer. The only question is, are they finding you or your competition?

For many specialist firms, the answer is frustrating. You see competitors with less experience ranking above you, and your website attracts inquiries that are poorly matched to your expertise.

   ---

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**What is the difference between SEO and Google Ads?**

SEO focuses on earning organic, unpaid visibility in search results through a long-term strategy of building authority and relevance. Google Ads is a paid advertising platform where you pay for immediate visibility. We often recommend a combined approach for the best results.

**How long does it take to see results from SEO?**

While some improvements can be seen within the first few months, meaningful and sustainable SEO results typically take six to twelve months to build. SEO is a long-term investment in your practice's digital authority.

**Can you guarantee a number one ranking on Google?**

No ethical SEO agency can guarantee a specific ranking. Google's algorithm is complex and constantly changing. We do guarantee a transparent, expert-led process that uses proven, ethical strategies to significantly improve your search visibility and organic traffic over time.

**My profession has strict advertising rules. Is SEO safe?**

Yes. Our entire SEO process is built around a "compliance-first" approach. We understand the specific advertising rules for your industry and focus on ethical strategies, like creating high-quality educational content, to build your authority safely and effectively.

**My competitors dominate the search results.**

**Can you really make a difference?** Yes. While they may have a head start, we specialise in identifying strategic opportunities they have missed. We focus on building deeper authority on niche, high-intent topics and dominating local search, allowing you to outmanoeuvre larger, less focused competitors.

**What is 'local SEO' and why is it so important?**

Local SEO focuses on making you visible to clients in your immediate geographic area, especially for "near me" searches. For most practices, this is critical. It involves optimising your Google Business Profile to appear in the "Map Pack," which is often the most valuable real estate on the search results page.

**Do I need to understand all the technical SEO jargon?**

Not at all. Your role is to be the expert in your field. Our role is to handle all the technical complexity and translate our work into the business outcomes you care about: more inquiries, better clients, and measurable growth.

**The New AI Revolution in Client Acquisition**

Your potential clients are already using AI to find expert help. The only question is whether they are finding you.

When someone asks ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity or any AI Chatbot questions about a specific legal issue or uses voice search to find a local specialist, is your firm part of the conversation? Most are not, which creates an enormous opportunity.

AI search is different from traditional Google search. Instead of showing a list of links, AI systems provide direct answers and recommendations. If your business is not optimised for AI understanding, you become invisible in these critical responses.

The challenge for all professional practices is that this optimisation must respect strict industry regulations. We have developed specific strategies that achieve both.

**\[Book My Free Consultation\]**

**A Tailored AI Strategy for Your Profession**

Effective AI optimisation is not a one-size-fits-all service. The right strategy depends on your industry's specific rules and your clients' search behaviour. Our approach is to build your authority safely and effectively within your professional context.

   ---

**Frequently Asked Questions**

**What is the difference between AI search and traditional Google search?**

Think of traditional Google search as a directory that gives you a list of links. You still have to visit the websites to find your answer. AI search acts more like a concierge. It understands the user's question and provides a direct, synthesized answer, often citing the most authoritative source. Our goal is to make you that source.

**How do you ensure AI-optimised content remains compliant with our industry's rules?**

Compliance is the foundation of our process. We are experts in the specific advertising guidelines for regulated professions, including AHPRA for healthcare and the Legal Professional Conduct Rules for law firms. Every piece of content is structured to be authoritative and helpful without making prohibited claims, ensuring we protect your professional reputation.

**Is using AI for marketing safe for our professional reputation?**

Yes, when done correctly. Our approach is not about creating fake content. It is about structuring your genuine expertise in a way that AI can understand and trust. By positioning you as the most credible and helpful answer to client questions, we enhance your reputation as a trusted authority in your field.

**My medical practice cannot use testimonials. How does this work with AHPRA's rules?**

We understand these restrictions completely. Our strategy for medical practices is built around AHPRA's guidelines. We focus on optimising educational content, practice information, and practitioner credentials. This builds authority and attracts patients by demonstrating expertise, not by using prohibited testimonials or making unlawful claims.

**How can this help my law firm stand out in a competitive market?**

In a competitive market, being seen as the definitive expert is key. AI search prioritises clear, authoritative answers. By optimising your firm's content to answer the specific questions your ideal clients are asking, we help you become the first and most trusted recommendation they see, generating higher-quality inquiries.

**How long does it take to see results from AI optimisation?**

While technical improvements can be implemented quickly, seeing a measurable impact on AI recommendations and voice search visibility typically takes three to six months. This is a long-term strategy to build sustainable authority that outlasts short-term advertising tactics and positions you as a market leader.

While a single piece of content has value, the true authority-building benefits of content marketing come from a consistent, ongoing strategy. We see it as a long-term asset-building process that delivers compounding returns over time.

**Can the content you create be used for other things?**

Absolutely. We encourage it. A key part of our strategy is repurposing. A pillar article can be turned into a series of social media posts, key points for an email newsletter, a video script, or a downloadable guide, maximising the return on every piece we create.
