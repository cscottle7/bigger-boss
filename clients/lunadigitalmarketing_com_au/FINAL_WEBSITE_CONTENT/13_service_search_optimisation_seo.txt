#Service Overview

Luna Digital delivers specialised SEO strategies for medical practices and legal firms that improve search rankings whilst maintaining strict compliance with professional advertising standards. Our approach focuses on building organic visibility for services and expertise areas that matter most to your practice growth.

Unlike generic SEO agencies, we understand the complex regulatory environment professional services operate within.

Our professional services SEO delivers sustainable organic growth, positions your practice as the local authority for your specialties, and drives qualified patient and client inquiries through strategic keyword targeting and content optimisation.

#How It Works: Medical Practices vs Legal Firms

##Medical Practice SEO
Medical practice SEO requires careful keyword targeting that attracts patients seeking your services whilst complying with therapeutic goods advertising restrictions. We optimise for condition-related searches, treatment options, and practitioner expertise without making prohibited health claims.

Our medical SEO approach includes local search optimisation for geographic patient acquisition, medical directory optimisation, and content strategies that demonstrate clinical expertise whilst maintaining AHPRA compliance standards.

We focus on building authority for your specialty areas through educational content optimisation, patient journey mapping from symptom research to appointment booking, and technical SEO that improves website performance for health-related searches.

##Legal Firm SEO
Legal firm SEO strategies target potential clients searching for legal services and advice within your practice areas. We optimise for legal issue searches, court process inquiries, and specific legal services whilst adhering to professional conduct requirements.

Our legal SEO includes local market dominance strategies, legal directory optimisation, and content approaches that demonstrate legal expertise without providing specific legal advice or inappropriately soliciting clients.

Legal SEO strategies we implement focus on practice area authority building, competitor analysis within legal markets, and reputation management that positions your firm as the trusted choice for legal services.

#Compliance Considerations

##AHPRA Compliance in Medical SEO
All medical practice SEO strategies strictly adhere to AHPRA advertising guidelines, ensuring optimised content doesn't contain prohibited health claims, therapeutic outcome promises, or before/after imagery that breaches advertising standards.

Our medical SEO compliance includes careful keyword selection that targets patient intent without making therapeutic claims, appropriate disclaimers in optimised content, and link building strategies that maintain professional credibility.

##Legal Professional Conduct Rules in SEO
Legal firm SEO must comply with professional conduct rules regarding client confidentiality, appropriate advertising, and professional standards. We ensure optimised content meets advertising restrictions whilst building search authority.
