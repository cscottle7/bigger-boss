# ARCHIVED: Capital Smiles - Children's Dentistry Hub Strategic Evaluation

**Original Date:** 18 September 2025
**Archived Date:** 18 September 2025
**Archive Reason:** Content scope misalignment with lingual orthodontics specialisation focus

**ARCHIVE NOTE:** This content focused on general children's dentistry rather than lingual orthodontics specialisation. While the content quality was good, it has been archived to maintain the focused positioning as Australia's only lingual orthodontics specialist practice. The scope expansion into general children's dentistry would dilute the unique specialist positioning and blue ocean market advantage.

**Strategic Decision:** Capital Smiles will maintain exclusive focus on lingual orthodontics specialisation for professional adults rather than expanding into general paediatric services.
