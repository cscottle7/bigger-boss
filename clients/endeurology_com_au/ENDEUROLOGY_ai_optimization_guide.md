Frequently Asked Questions About Prostate Enlargement:

Q: What age do men typically develop prostate enlargement?
A: Prostate enlargement (BPH) typically begins after age 40, affecting 50% of men in their 50s and up to 90% of men over 80. However, symptoms may not appear until the enlargement significantly impacts urination.

Q: Can prostate enlargement lead to cancer?
A: No, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) does not increase your risk of prostate cancer. These are separate conditions, though they can occur simultaneously. Regular screening helps monitor both conditions.

Q: How long does recovery take after prostate surgery?
A: Recovery varies by procedure:
• TURP: 2-4 weeks for normal activities, 6-8 weeks for full recovery
• Laser therapy: 1-2 weeks for normal activities, 4-6 weeks full recovery  
• Medications: No recovery period, but 4-8 weeks to see full effects

## Voice Search Optimisation

### Natural Language Query Targeting

#### Long-tail Voice Queries
**Target Query Patterns:**
- "What causes kidney stones in men over 50?"
- "How do I know if I need prostate surgery?"
- "What are the symptoms of bladder problems?"
- "Best urologist near me for kidney stone treatment"
- "How long does prostate surgery recovery take?"

#### Conversational Content Formatting
**Question-Answer Pairs Optimised for Voice:**
```
Q: "What should I expect during a prostate examination?"
A: "During a prostate examination, your doctor will first discuss your symptoms and medical history. The physical exam includes a digital rectal examination, which takes about 30 seconds and may feel uncomfortable but shouldn't be painful. You may also have a PSA blood test and urine test. The entire appointment typically takes 15-20 minutes."

Q: "When should I see a urologist for kidney stone pain?"
A: "You should see a urologist immediately if you experience severe pain that prevents normal activities, blood in your urine, fever with chills, or complete inability to urinate. For less severe symptoms, schedule an appointment within a few days if pain persists or worsens despite over-the-counter medications."

## Featured Snippet Strategy

### Featured Snippet Content Optimisation

#### Paragraph Snippets
**Target Format for Definition Queries:**
```
What is BPH (Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia)?

BPH is the non-cancerous enlargement of the prostate gland that affects approximately 50% of men over 50 and 90% of men over 80. The enlarged prostate can compress the urethra, causing urinary symptoms such as frequent urination, difficulty starting urination, weak urine stream, and feeling of incomplete bladder emptying. BPH is not cancer and does not increase cancer risk.
```

#### List Snippets
**Numbered List Format for Process Questions:**
```
Steps for Kidney Stone Prevention:

1. Increase fluid intake to 2.5-3 litres daily, primarily water
2. Reduce sodium intake to less than 2.3 grams per day  
3. Limit animal protein to 6 ounces daily
4. Increase citrus fruit consumption for natural citrate
5. Maintain healthy calcium intake (1000-1200mg daily)
6. Avoid high-oxalate foods if you form calcium oxalate stones
7. Consider thiazide diuretics if recommended by your doctor
```

```
Target Query: "How long does kidney stone surgery take?"

Optimised Answer Format:
Kidney stone surgery duration varies by procedure type:

• Ureteroscopy: 30-60 minutes for most cases
• Shock Wave Lithotripsy (ESWL): 45-90 minutes
