#### Material Facts Disclosure Obligation

**Legal Principle:**
- Vendors must disclose material facts that could influence buyer's decision to purchase
- Material facts affect purchase decision or price buyer willing to pay
- Duty of disclosure protects buyers and maintains market fairness

#### Natural Disasters - 5 Year Disclosure Rule

**Must Disclose if Property Subject to:**

**Flooding from Natural Events (Last 5 Years):**
- Any flooding of property in last five years
- Extent and severity of flooding
- Damage caused by flooding
- Remediation work completed

**Bush Fire Events (Last 5 Years):**
- Any bushfire affecting property
- Damage to structures or landscaping
- Bushfire preparation work or upgrades
- Insurance claims related to bushfire

**Camden Context:**

**Common Examples:**
- Carports or pergolas without council approval

- Granny flats without development consent
- Enclosed balconies or verandas

**Consequences of Unapproved Work:**

**Definition:**
- Public sale conducted by auctioneer or qualified real estate agent
- Property sold to highest bidder
- Legally binding at fall of hammer

**Advantages for Vendors:**
- Quick sale if home in high demand

- Beneficial in hot property markets with strong demand
- Competition can induce bidding war, resulting in higher price
- Fixed auction date helps coordinate timing with new purchase

**Disadvantages for Vendors:**
- Auction advertising campaigns typically cost more than private sales ($5,000-$15,000 vs $2,000-$5,000)
- Unsuccessful auction can be uncomfortably public exposure of lack of interest
- No cooling-off period for buyers (can deter some cautious purchasers)
- Reserve price setting requires careful judgment
