## 1.0 Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes comprehensive, research-backed methodologies for search intent analysis and keyword research that form the strategic foundation for all content planning within the Autonomous Agentic Marketing System. It provides systematic approaches to intent classification, SERP-based validation, and keyword opportunity assessment using 2025 best practices, ensuring every content piece is built on solid search intelligence and directly supports user needs and business objectives.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to all SEO analysts, content strategists, AI agents (specifically `@plan_creator` and `@content_forge` squad members), and human reviewers at Discover Web Solutions. It governs all keyword research, search intent analysis, and content topic development activities, ensuring consistent, data-driven approaches across all client projects and internal content initiatives.

## 3.0 Definitions

* **Search Intent:** The fundamental purpose or motivation behind a user's search query, representing their specific information need, problem to solve, or action to complete.
* **Intent Classification Framework:** The systematic categorisation of user intent into four primary categories: Informational ("Know"), Navigational ("Go"), Commercial Investigation, and Transactional ("Do").
* **SERP-Based Validation:** The methodology of using live Search Engine Results Page analysis to confirm and refine initial intent assumptions through observable ranking patterns and features.
* **Keyword Clustering:** The systematic grouping of related keywords based on semantic similarity, user intent alignment, and topical relevance to create comprehensive content themes.
* **Long-Tail Keyword:** Extended, specific keyword phrases (typically 3+ words) that demonstrate clear user intent and often have lower competition but higher conversion potential.
* **Keyword Difficulty Assessment:** The systematic evaluation of ranking competitiveness for target keywords using multiple data points including domain authority, content quality, and SERP features.
* **Semantic Keyword Research:** The process of identifying conceptually related keywords and topics that support comprehensive content coverage around a central theme.
* **Search Volume Validation:** The cross-platform verification of keyword search volumes using multiple data sources to ensure accuracy and identify trends.

## 4.0 Procedures

This SOP provides systematic procedures for establishing search intent foundations, conducting comprehensive keyword research, and validating opportunities through SERP analysis.

### 4.1 Procedure: Comprehensive Search Intent Classification Framework

Modern search intent analysis requires systematic classification that goes beyond basic categorisation to understand nuanced user motivations and content requirements.

#### **4.1.1 The Four Core Search Intent Categories (2025 Framework)**

All keyword research must begin with precise intent classification using this enhanced framework:

**1. Informational Intent ("Know"):**
* **Definition:** Users seek to acquire knowledge, understand concepts, or learn how to perform tasks
* **Query Characteristics:** Question words (what, how, why, when, where), definition requests, tutorial searches
* **User Mindset:** Educational, problem-solving, skill acquisition
* **Examples:** "what is content marketing," "how to optimise website speed," "why does SEO matter"
* **Content Alignment:** Educational blog posts, guides, tutorials, FAQ content
* **SERP Signals:** Featured snippets, "People Also Ask" boxes, educational content dominance

**2. Navigational Intent ("Go"):**
* **Definition:** Users intend to reach a specific website, brand, or known resource
* **Query Characteristics:** Brand names, specific product names, login terms, direct navigation attempts
* **User Mindset:** Destination-focused, brand-aware, seeking specific resource
* **Examples:** "Facebook login," "Adobe Photoshop download," "Neil Patel blog"
* **Content Alignment:** Branded pages, official resources, direct access points
* **SERP Signals:** Brand dominance in results, sitelinks, branded SERP features

**3. Commercial Investigation Intent:**
* **Definition:** Users research and evaluate options before making purchasing decisions, comparing alternatives
* **Query Characteristics:** Comparison terms, review requests, "best of" searches, evaluation criteria
* **User Mindset:** Pre-purchase research, option evaluation, decision support seeking
* **Examples:** "best project management software," "WordPress vs Shopify comparison," "marketing automation reviews"
* **Content Alignment:** Comparison guides, review content, evaluation frameworks, feature analysis
* **SERP Signals:** Review sites, comparison content, product carousels, buying guides

**4. Transactional Intent ("Do"):**
* **Definition:** Users ready to take specific action, typically making purchases or completing tasks
* **Query Characteristics:** Action verbs (buy, purchase, order, download), location-specific terms, immediate need indicators
* **User Mindset:** Action-oriented, decision made, seeking completion path
* **Examples:** "buy SEO audit software," "hire content marketing agency," "download keyword research tool"
* **Content Alignment:** Product/service pages, landing pages, conversion-optimised content
* **SERP Signals:** Shopping ads, product listings, local results, commercial page dominance

#### **4.1.2 Advanced Intent Modifiers and Contextual Factors**

Beyond primary intent, analyse these critical modifiers that impact content strategy:

**Geographic Intent Modifiers:**
* **Local Intent:** "near me," city names, regional terms requiring location-specific content
* **Global Intent:** Universal topics requiring broad, location-neutral approaches
* **Regional Preferences:** Cultural, language, and regional variation considerations

**Temporal Intent Modifiers:**
* **Immediate Intent:** "now," "today," "urgent" indicating time-sensitive needs
* **Planned Intent:** "best time to," "when should," indicating future planning
* **Seasonal Intent:** Time-bound searches requiring seasonal content strategies

**Expertise Level Modifiers:**
* **Beginner Intent:** "basics," "introduction," "getting started" requiring foundational content
* **Advanced Intent:** "advanced," "expert," "professional" requiring sophisticated content
* **Comparative Intent:** "vs," "compared to," "difference between" requiring analytical content
