| `CLAUDE.md` | Primary agent configuration | AI Agents |
| `README_CLEAN_SYSTEM.md` | Main system overview | All Users |
| `CLIENT_ORGANIZATION_STANDARDS.md` | Client folder standards | AI Agents |

## Documentation Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns
- **AI Instructions**: What the system needs to know to operate
- **User Instructions**: What humans need to do manually
- **Historical Archive**: Context and learning from past issues

### Consolidated Guides
Instead of scattered documentation, we provide:
- **Single AI Operation Guide**: Everything agents need in one place
- **Single User Manual**: Everything users need in one place
- **Organized Archive**: Historical context when needed

### Clean Root Directory
Only essential, actively-used files remain in root:
- Configuration files (CLAUDE.md)
- Overview documentation (README)
- Active standards and research

Everything else is organized in this instructions directory.

## Navigation Tips

### For AI Agents
1. Read `CLAUDE.md` in root (primary config)
2. Reference `for_ai/SYSTEM_OPERATION_GUIDE.md` for operations
3. Check specific guides in `for_ai/` for detailed topics

### For Human Users
1. Start with root `README_CLEAN_SYSTEM.md`
2. Follow `for_users/USER_MANUAL.md` for setup
3. Use `for_users/QUICK_REFERENCE_AUTOMATION.md` for commands

### For Troubleshooting
1. Check current guides first (for_ai/ or for_users/)
2. Review `archive/troubleshooting/` for historical issues
3. Check `archive/testing/` for past test results
