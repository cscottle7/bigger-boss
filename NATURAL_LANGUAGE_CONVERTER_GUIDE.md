# Natural Language Document Converter

A conversational interface for converting Markdown documents to Word format and automatically uploading them to Google Drive. Simply tell the system what you want to convert using plain English.

## Quick Start

### Simple Command Line Usage

```bash
# Convert a specific document
python convert_my_docs.py "Convert the token optimization SOP to Word format"

# Convert multiple documents
python convert_my_docs.py "Turn all my SOPs into Word documents"

# Find and convert
python convert_my_docs.py "Find the Universal Orchestrator checklist and convert it to docx"
```

### Interactive Mode

```bash
# Start interactive conversation
python system/core_tools/convert_cli.py
```

## How It Works

### 1. Natural Language Understanding

The system understands conversational requests like:

- **Single File Conversion:**
  - "Convert my SEO report to Word format"
  - "Turn the Universal Orchestrator Checklist into a .docx document"
  - "Export the content refinement guide as a Word document"

- **Batch Operations:**
  - "Turn all my SOPs into Word documents"
  - "Convert all reports in the analysis folder to docx"
  - "Export every checklist as Word format"

- **Search and Convert:**
  - "Find the token optimization guide and convert it"
  - "Locate any AI readiness documents and turn them into Word"
  - "Search for competitive analysis reports and export them"

### 2. Intelligent File Matching

The system automatically:

- **Recognizes common file types** (SOPs, reports, checklists, guides)
- **Searches multiple directories** (system/sops, system/orchestration, system/reports, clients)
- **Matches partial filenames** ("token optimization" matches "SOP_Token_Optimization_2025.md")
- **Handles casual references** ("that analysis" or "my report")

### 3. Automatic Processing

For each conversion, the system:

1. **Finds matching files** based on your description
2. **Converts Markdown to Word** with rich formatting preserved
3. **Uploads to Google Drive** in organized folders
4. **Provides detailed feedback** about what was accomplished

## Example Interactions

### Example 1: Single File Conversion

```
User: "Convert the token optimization SOP to Word format"

System: [SUCCESS] Brilliant! I've converted 'SOP_Token_Optimization_2025' to Word format and uploaded it to Google Drive.

Details:
  * Source File: SOP_Token_Optimization_2025
  * Output File: SOP_Token_Optimization_2025.docx  
  * File Size: 41.4 KB
  * Location: system/reports/docx_exports/
  * Drive Status: Uploaded to Analysis Reports folder

Next Actions:
  -> The document is ready for team collaboration
  -> You can access it in Google Drive under 'Analysis Reports'
  -> Would you like me to convert any other files?
```

### Example 2: Batch Conversion

```
User: "Turn all my SOPs into Word documents"

System: [BATCH SUCCESS] Excellent! I've successfully converted all 30 SOPs to Word format and uploaded them to Google Drive.

Summary:
  * Successfully converted: 30 files
  * Failed: 0 files
  * Output location: system/reports/docx_exports/

Next Actions:
  -> All SOPs are now available for team collaboration
  -> Documents are organised in the Google Drive Analysis Reports folder
  -> Team members can access and edit the Word documents directly
```

### Example 3: Smart File Finding
