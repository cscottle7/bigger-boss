### FAQ Section (500 words)
**H2:** "Frequently Asked Questions"

#### What permits are required for fuel storage in Australia?
Permit requirements vary by state, tank capacity, and installation type. NSW requires EPA notification for tanks >5,000L, Queensland mandates mining safety permits, Western Australia requires industrial storage frameworks, and Victoria needs environmental protection compliance. We handle all permit applications and regulatory liaison as part of our comprehensive installation service.

#### How often must fuel tanks be inspected for AS1940:2017 compliance?
AS1940:2017 mandates annual inspections for tanks exceeding 2,000L capacity, with quarterly monitoring for installations over 10,000L. Additional requirements include daily visual inspections, monthly leak detection testing, and comprehensive safety audits. Our digital compliance platform automates reminder scheduling and documentation management.

#### What's the difference between biodiesel and HVO storage requirements?
Biodiesel (B20) storage requires specialized materials resistant to biodiesel properties, temperature control systems, and water separation protocols. HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) offers superior storage stability, cold weather performance, and longer storage life. Both require compliance documentation for sustainability reporting and government incentives.

#### Can existing fuel tanks be upgraded for AS1940:2017 compliance?
Many existing tanks can be retrofitted with compliance equipment including leak detection systems, secondary containment, safety equipment, and monitoring systems. We provide comprehensive assessment services, upgrade feasibility studies, and complete retrofitting solutions with compliance certification.

#### What safety equipment is mandatory under AS1940:2017 standards?
Mandatory safety equipment includes overfill protection systems (95% capacity limit), continuous level monitoring and alarm systems, fire suppression and emergency venting, secondary containment and spill management, and environmental protection measures. All equipment requires annual certification and testing.

#### How do you ensure environmental protection during fuel storage?
Environmental protection includes double-wall construction with leak detection, continuous electronic monitoring systems, groundwater contamination prevention, and comprehensive spill response protocols. All installations include environmental impact assessments and ongoing monitoring to prevent contamination incidents.
