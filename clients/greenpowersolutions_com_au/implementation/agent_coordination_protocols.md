## DAILY COORDINATION PROTOCOLS

### Daily Stand-Up Framework (Days 3-13)
**Time**: 9:00 AM AEST daily  
**Duration**: 15 minutes maximum  
**Participants**: All active specialist agents + Lead Orchestrator

**Standard Agenda**:
1. **Progress Updates** (2 minutes per active agent)
   - Previous day completion status
   - Current day objectives
   - Any technical accuracy concerns identified

2. **Cross-Pillar Dependencies** (5 minutes)
   - Integration requirements between pillars
   - Technical specification alignment needs
   - Cross-reference accuracy verification

3. **Resource Allocation** (3 minutes)
   - Quality Controller review scheduling
   - Schema Specialist coordination needs
   - Integration Specialist collaboration requirements

**Escalation Triggers**:
- Technical accuracy concerns requiring cross-specialist consultation
- Timeline delays threatening critical path
- SOP compliance issues requiring immediate attention

### Agent-to-Agent Communication Standards

#### Inter-Agent Query Protocol
**Format**: [AGENT-NAME] → [TARGET-AGENT] → [QUERY-TYPE] → [PRIORITY]

**Example**: 
```
[GENERATOR-SPECIALIST] → [LOAD-BANK-SPECIALIST] → [TECHNICAL-SPECIFICATION] → [HIGH]
Query: Generator power output specifications for load bank testing compatibility verification
Required Response Time: 4 hours
Context: Section 3.2 generator capacity ratings need cross-validation for testing procedures
```

#### Technical Clarification Requests
**Standard Process**:
1. **Initial Request**: Direct agent-to-agent communication
2. **Documentation**: Log all technical clarifications in shared knowledge base
3. **Quality Controller Notification**: Flag any specification discrepancies
4. **Resolution Confirmation**: Both agents confirm alignment before proceeding
