## 1.0 Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes mandatory file organization standards ensuring all agents maintain consistent, professional, and scalable folder structures for client projects. With proper file organization reducing project delivery times by up to 50% and improving team collaboration efficiency by 75%, this SOP implements research-backed organizational frameworks that ensure zero files are created outside designated client directories whilst maintaining seamless project navigation and handover capabilities.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to all AI agents, human reviewers, and project personnel working within the Bigger Boss Agent System, including:
- All `SiteSpect`, `ContentForge`, and `StrategyNexus` squad outputs
- Project initialization, file creation, and document management activities
- Client deliverable organization and archival processes
- Cross-project file sharing and reference management
- Template standardization and folder structure maintenance

## 3.0 Definitions

* **Client Folder Structure:** The mandatory hierarchical organization system for all client-related files within the `clients/` directory
* **Domain-Based Naming:** File naming convention using client domain format (e.g., `clientname_com_au`)
* **Subfolder Standardization:** Consistent use of strategy/, research/, content/, technical/, and implementation/ directories
* **Project Navigation Hub:** The README.md file serving as the central navigation point for all project documentation
* **File Provenance:** Complete tracking of file origin, creation, and modification history
* **Cross-Project References:** Links between related files across different client folders

## 4.0 Procedures

### 4.1 Procedure: Mandatory Client Folder Creation Protocol

All client work must begin with proper folder structure establishment.

#### **Step 1: Client Folder Initialization**
**MANDATORY:** All client files MUST be created within the designated client folder structure.

1. **Primary Folder Creation:**
   - Navigate to `clients/` directory in project root
   - Create client folder using exact format: `{client_domain_name}/`
   - Examples: `sydneycoachcharter_com_au/`, `precisionuppergisurgery_com_au/`
   - **NEVER** create files in root directory or random locations
   - **NEVER** use spaces, special characters, or capital letters in folder names

2. **Subfolder Structure Implementation:**
   - Create ALL required subfolders during initialization:
     ```
     clients/{client_domain_name}/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Project navigation hub (MANDATORY)
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md          # Executive summary (MANDATORY)
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ strategy/                    # Strategic planning documents
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ research/                    # Market intelligence & analysis
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ content/                     # Content strategy & guidelines
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ technical/                   # Technical audits & recommendations
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation/              # Execution tracking
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/                      # Supporting materials (optional)
     ```

3. **Folder Structure Validation:**
   - Verify all mandatory folders exist before creating first document
   - Confirm folder naming follows exact specification above
   - Test folder accessibility and write permissions
   - Document folder creation timestamp and responsible agent

#### **Step 2: README.md Project Navigation Hub Creation**
**MANDATORY:** Every client folder MUST contain a comprehensive README.md file.

1. **Navigation Hub Requirements:**
   - Include complete project overview and objectives
   - List all major deliverables with file locations
   - Provide status updates for ongoing work
   - Include team member responsibilities and contacts
   - Link to all major documents with brief descriptions

2. **README.md Structure Standard:**
   ```markdown

   ```

### 4.2 Procedure: File Naming and Location Standards

Establish consistent naming conventions and location rules for all client files.

#### **Step 1: File Naming Convention Implementation**
**Apply consistent naming across all client documents:**

1. **Primary Document Naming:**
   - Format: `{CLIENT_PREFIX}_{document_type}.md`
   - Examples: `SYDNEYCOACHCHARTER_competitive_analysis.md`
   - Use ALL CAPS for client prefix (domain without extensions)
   - Use lowercase with underscores for document type
   - Replace dots and hyphens in domain with underscores

2. **Subfolder Document Naming:**
   - When using standardized subfolders, use descriptive naming:
   - Examples: `competitive_analysis.md`, `audience_personas.md`
   - Maintain consistency with template structure
   - Avoid redundant client prefixes in subfolder documents

3. **Special Document Types:**
   - Progress tracking: `execution_tracking_report.md`
   - Project checklists: `PROJECT_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Overview documents: `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`
   - Raw data files: Store in `raw_data/` subfolder when needed

#### **Step 2: Mandatory File Location Rules**
**Enforce strict location requirements for all document types:**

1. **Strategic Documents Location:**
   - **MUST** be placed in `clients/{domain}/strategy/` folder
   - Include: research briefs, implementation plans, positioning strategy
   - Link from main README.md with clear descriptions
   - Maintain consistent cross-references between strategic documents

2. **Research Documents Location:**
   - **MUST** be placed in `clients/{domain}/research/` folder
   - Include: competitive analysis, audience personas, keyword research
