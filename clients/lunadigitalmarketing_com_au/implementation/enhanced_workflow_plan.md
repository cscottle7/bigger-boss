# Luna Digital Marketing - Enhanced Workflow Plan
**Date**: 12/09/2025  
**Project**: Complete Content Workflow Redesign  
**Director**: Natasha Chandra  

## Executive Overview

This enhanced workflow plan addresses critical gaps identified in the current Luna Digital Marketing content process and establishes a comprehensive quality assurance system with proper SOP compliance integration.

## Critical Issues Identified

### Workflow Gaps
- ❌ **SOP Steward Missing**: Not integrated into workflow - copywriters need SOP knowledge before content creation
- ❌ **Incomplete Feedback Loops**: AI optimization not completed, Answer First sections missing
- ❌ **Character Count Assessment**: Not included in quality checks

### Content Quality Issues
- ❌ **Target Market Too Narrow**: Content focused only on "professional services" limits other business types
- ❌ **Unsubstantiated Claims**: "Answered within 2 business hours", "Same-day response guaranteed", audit pricing ($2,997, etc.)
- ❌ **Director Name**: Needs updating to Natasha Chandra throughout
- ❌ **Executive Summaries**: Should be converted to Answer First sections
- ❌ **Areas We Serve Headings**: Need format change ("Marketing Services in Sydney" not "Sydney Marketing Services")
- ❌ **Email in CTAs**: Should be removed from call-to-action buttons
- ❌ **Medical Practice Results**: Need verification - where did these statistics come from?
