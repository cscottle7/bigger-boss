- Structure information for voice synthesis clarity

**Example Conversational Flow:**
```
Many people ask us, "How long does physiotherapy treatment typically take?" 

The honest answer is that it depends on several factors. Most patients see initial improvement within 2-3 sessions, but complete recovery can take anywhere from 4-12 weeks.

Here's what influences your treatment timeline:

First, the severity of your condition plays a major role. A minor muscle strain might resolve in just a few sessions, while a complex shoulder injury could require months of targeted therapy.

Second, your commitment to prescribed exercises significantly impacts recovery speed. Patients who follow their home exercise programs typically recover 40% faster than those who only attend clinic sessions.

Finally, any underlying health conditions can affect healing rates. Conditions like diabetes or arthritis may extend recovery times, but don't worry – we adjust treatment plans accordingly.
