# Feedback Loop Agents - Implementation Guide

## Quick Start Implementation

### Step 1: Add New Agent Types to Claude Code

Add these 4 new agent types to your Claude Code agent configuration:

```yaml
# Add to your Claude Code agent system
feedback_loop_agents:
  - clarity_conciseness_editor
  - cognitive_load_minimizer  
  - content_critique_specialist
  - ai_text_naturalizer
```

    They help businesses achieve better results through advanced technology.
    Our platform offers comprehensive analytics and reporting capabilities.
    """
    
    # Run through feedback loop
    result = execute_feedback_loop(sample_content)
    
    # Verify improvements
    assert result.final_scores['clarity_conciseness_editor'] >= 8
    assert result.final_scores['cognitive_load_minimizer'] >= 7
    assert result.final_scores['content_critique_specialist'] >= 7
    assert result.final_scores['ai_text_naturalizer'] >= 8
    assert result.iteration_count <= 3
    
    print(f"Content improved in {result.iteration_count} iterations")
    print(f"Final aggregate score: {result.aggregate_score}/10")
```

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] Add 4 new agent types to Claude Code system
- [ ] Update all task_deps.md files with feedback loops
- [ ] Implement enhanced quality_gate_orchestrator
- [ ] Enhance content_refiner for targeted improvements  
- [ ] Configure scoring thresholds for each agent
- [ ] Set up iteration limits and safety mechanisms
- [ ] Test with sample content pieces
- [ ] Monitor performance and adjust thresholds as needed
- [ ] Train team on new iterative workflow
- [ ] Update documentation and SOPs

This implementation ensures every piece of content goes through comprehensive, iterative improvement before final delivery while maintaining efficiency and preventing infinite loops.
