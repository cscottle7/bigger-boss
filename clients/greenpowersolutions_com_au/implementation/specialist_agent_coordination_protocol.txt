Green Power Solutions - Specialist Agent Coordination Protocol
#Phase 2 Content Creation Implementation (Days 3-10)

Document Type: Agent Coordination Framework  
Implementation Phase: Phase 2 Content Creation  
Date Created: 8 September 2025  
Status: Active Implementation Protocol


==================================================


#EXECUTION SEQUENCING STRATEGY

Following the strategic workflow sequencing established in the main workflow, content creation proceeds in strategic order with overlapping quality reviews to ensure technical accuracy and cross-pillar consistency.

##Content Creation Sequence
1. Generator Pillar (Days 3-5) - Primary foundation
2. Load Bank Testing (Days 4-6) - Technical dependency on generator specs
3. Hybrid Lighting (Days 6-8) - Cross-reference generator specifications
4. Tank Storage (Days 8-10) - Integration with all systems

##Quality Gate Integration
- Gate 1 Technical Review: Day 5 (Generator + Load Bank)
- Gate 2 SOP Compliance: Days 7-8 (Generator + Load Bank + Hybrid Lighting)
- Integration Reviews: Days 6, 9, 12 (Cross-pillar consistency)


==================================================
