# SOP: Automated Content Refinement System with Multi-Persona Validation

**Version**: 1.0  
**Effective Date**: 03/09/2025  
**Purpose**: Implement automated content audit, refinement, optimization with multi-persona validation  
**Addresses**: User requirement for automated content rewriting until all quality gates passed  

---

## **OVERVIEW & REQUIREMENTS**

### **Current Problem Identified**:
> "I also need the content creation phase to audit, refine, optimise and use the different personas. this should then be fed back and re written automitically until everything is passed. this currently doesn't happen"

### **Solution Framework**:
- **Enhanced multi-persona validation**: 7 comprehensive validation perspectives including Expert, Beginner, Skeptic, Buyer, plus specialized E-E-A-T, Humanization, and Mobile Optimization validators
- **Automated feedback loop**: Continuous refinement until standards met
- **Quality gate enforcement**: No publication until all personas approve
- **British English compliance**: Mandatory throughout all refinement cycles
- **Mobile-first validation**: Ensures content works effectively on mobile devices
- **Maximum iterations**: 3 automatic rewrites before manual intervention

### **Success Criteria**:
- All 4 core personas score content >85/100
- All 3 specialized validation phases score >85/100 (Quality & Clarity >90/100)
- British English compliance: 100% (mandatory)
- Mobile optimization validated
- E-E-A-T signals properly demonstrated
- Natural, human-like language achieved
- Brand voice consistency preserved
- Automated refinement without human intervention

    for persona, feedback in persona_feedback.items():
        if feedback['score'] < 85:
            if persona == 'expert':
                refined_content = enhance_technical_accuracy(refined_content, feedback)
            elif persona == 'beginner':  
                refined_content = simplify_language(refined_content, feedback)
            elif persona == 'skeptic':
                refined_content = strengthen_evidence(refined_content, feedback)
            elif persona == 'buyer':
