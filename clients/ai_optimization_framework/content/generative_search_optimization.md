## Answer Engine Readiness Framework

### 1. Conversational Query Optimization

**Natural Language Question Integration**
- **Primary Questions**: "What is", "How do", "Why should", "When to"
- **Secondary Questions**: "How much does", "Where can I", "Who should"
- **Australian-Specific Queries**: "In Australia", "Australian regulations", "Local requirements"

**Query Pattern Examples:**
```
Primary: "What is digital marketing and why is it important for Australian businesses?"
Secondary: "How much does digital marketing cost for small businesses in Australia?"
Tertiary: "Where can Australian businesses find qualified digital marketing professionals?"
```

### 2. Context Window Optimization

**AI System Context Limitations (September 2025)**
- **ChatGPT**: 32,000 token context window
- **Claude**: 100,000 token context window  
- **Google AI**: Variable context based on query complexity
- **Perplexity**: 16,000 token effective processing window

**Content Structure for Context Efficiency:**
```html
<article class="context-optimized">
    <!-- Essential Information Block (First 500 words) -->
    <section class="primary-context">
        <h1>[Primary Topic]</h1>
        <p class="topic-summary">[Core concept in 2-3 sentences]</p>
        <div class="key-takeaways">
            [3-5 bullet points covering essential information]
        </div>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Supporting Information (Next 1000 words) -->
    <section class="secondary-context">
        [Detailed explanations and examples]
    </section>
    
    <!-- Advanced Information (Remaining content) -->
    <section class="tertiary-context">
        [Technical details and comprehensive coverage]
    </section>
</article>
