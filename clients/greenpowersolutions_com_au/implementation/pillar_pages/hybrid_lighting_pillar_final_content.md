## Frequently Asked Questions: Comprehensive Technical Information

### How does hybrid solar-diesel lighting achieve 90% fuel reduction compared to traditional systems?

Hybrid lighting systems prioritise solar energy during daylight hours, storing excess energy in high-capacity lithium-ion battery systems for evening and night operation. Diesel backup generators only activate when battery levels drop below 20% capacity or during extended periods of insufficient solar irradiance, typically occurring less than 10% of operating time.

**Technical Process:**
- **Daytime Operation**: Solar photovoltaic arrays generate electricity directly powering lighting systems whilst simultaneously charging battery storage
- **Evening Operation**: Battery storage provides power for lighting systems with advanced energy management optimising runtime
- **Backup Activation**: Diesel generator automatically activates only when battery capacity drops below preset thresholds
- **Fuel Reduction Achievement**: Solar and battery systems provide 90% of total energy requirements with diesel supplying only 10% during extended poor weather

**Performance Verification**: Independent testing validates 90% fuel reduction across diverse Australian climate conditions with comprehensive monitoring confirming consistent performance achievement.
