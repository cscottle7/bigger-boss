#Frequently Asked Questions

##What permits are required for fuel storage in Australia?

Permit requirements vary significantly by state, tank capacity, and installation type. NSW requires Environmental Protection Authority notification for tanks exceeding 5,000L capacity, Queensland mandates mining safety permits for industrial applications, Western Australia requires dangerous goods licensing through Department of Mines, and Victoria needs Environmental Protection Authority approvals for commercial installations.

We handle all permit applications and regulatory liaison as part of our comprehensive installation service, ensuring complete compliance whilst minimising administrative burden on your operations. Our regulatory experts maintain current knowledge of all Australian requirements and coordinate directly with regulatory authorities throughout the approval process.

Source: [Australian Government - National Environment Protection Council](https://www.nepc.gov.au/nepms/fuel-storage) - Current Requirements

##How often must fuel tanks be inspected for AS1940:2017 compliance?

AS1940:2017 mandates annual inspections for tanks exceeding 2,000L capacity, with quarterly monitoring for installations over 10,000L capacity. Additional requirements include daily visual inspections by site personnel, monthly leak detection testing, and comprehensive safety audits for high-capacity installations.

Our digital compliance platform automates reminder scheduling and documentation management, ensuring timely compliance whilst reducing administrative overhead. We provide comprehensive inspection services with certified technicians and complete documentation supporting insurance and regulatory requirements.

##What's the difference between biodiesel and HVO storage requirements?

Biodiesel (B20) storage requires specialised materials resistant to biodiesel's chemical properties, temperature control systems maintaining fuel quality, and water separation protocols preventing contamination. Regular fuel quality testing ensures optimal performance and equipment protection.

HVO (Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil) offers superior storage stability, excellent cold weather performance, and longer storage life compared to traditional biodiesel blends. Both require comprehensive compliance documentation for sustainability reporting and government incentive programs, which we provide as part of our integrated service offering.

##Can existing fuel tanks be upgraded for AS1940:2017 compliance?

Many existing tanks can be retrofitted with compliance equipment including leak detection systems, secondary containment, safety equipment, and monitoring systems. However, upgrade feasibility depends on tank age, construction materials, and current condition.

We provide comprehensive assessment services evaluating upgrade feasibility, cost-effectiveness compared to replacement, and complete retrofitting solutions with compliance certification. Our assessment includes structural evaluation, regulatory compliance analysis, and detailed cost-benefit analysis supporting informed decision-making.

##What safety equipment is mandatory under AS1940:2017 standards?

Mandatory safety equipment includes overfill protection systems preventing overflow at 95% capacity, continuous level monitoring and alarm systems with remote capability, fire suppression and emergency venting systems, and comprehensive secondary containment and spill management systems.

All equipment requires annual certification and testing by qualified technicians. We provide complete safety equipment installation, certification, and ongoing maintenance ensuring continuous compliance and optimal safety performance throughout the equipment lifecycle.

##How do you ensure environmental protection during fuel storage?

Environmental protection includes double-wall construction with continuous leak detection, electronic monitoring systems providing early contamination detection, groundwater contamination prevention through advanced containment, and comprehensive spill response protocols.

All installations include detailed environmental impact assessments and ongoing monitoring preventing contamination incidents. Our environmental protection systems exceed current requirements providing future regulatory protection and complete peace of mind for environmental liability management.

##What are the cost benefits of bulk fuel storage systems?

Bulk fuel storage delivers 12-25% cost savings through volume purchasing discounts, 35-50% reduction in delivery costs through consolidated scheduling, insurance premium reductions of 20-30% through certified safety systems, and complete elimination of regulatory penalty risks.

Our comprehensive cost-benefit analysis demonstrates typical payback periods of 18-24 months through operational optimisation. We provide detailed financial modelling supporting informed investment decisions with transparent cost analysis and performance guarantees.

##How does integrated fuel management improve operational efficiency?

Integrated fuel management combines tank storage with generator systems and load bank testing for comprehensive power solutions, delivering 30-40% reduction in administrative overhead, automated compliance reporting reducing regulatory burden, and predictive maintenance scheduling optimising operational efficiency.

Our unified approach provides single-supplier accountability, coordinated service schedules, and comprehensive performance monitoring across all power infrastructure components ensuring optimal efficiency and operational continuity.
