Q: How much can I save with solar panels in Sydney?
A: The average Sydney household saves $800-$1,200 annually with solar panels. Actual savings depend on your energy usage, system size, and electricity rates. Most systems pay for themselves within 5-7 years.
```

```
Q: How long does solar installation take?
A: Physical installation typically takes 1-2 days for residential properties. The complete process from initial consultation to grid connection usually takes 2-4 weeks, including permits and inspections.
