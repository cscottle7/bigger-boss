## Frequently Asked Questions

### How often should generators be load tested for optimal performance?

Australian electrical installation standards require regular performance validation for critical power systems. Industry best practice recommends monthly testing at 30% load capacity for standby generators, with annual 100% load testing for critical applications. Data centres require quarterly comprehensive testing, mining operations benefit from monthly validation protocols, and construction sites require commissioning plus periodic testing throughout project duration. Our testing schedules follow manufacturer recommendations and insurance requirements whilst optimizing operational efficiency.

### What's the difference between resistive and reactive load testing?

Resistive load testing validates basic power generation capacity under pure resistive loads, measuring voltage regulation and frequency stability under straightforward electrical loads. Reactive load testing evaluates power quality under real-world conditions including capacitive and inductive loads, harmonic analysis, and power factor testing from 0.8 lagging to 0.8 leading, providing comprehensive power system validation.

### Can load bank testing be performed without shutting down critical operations?

Yes - we specialise in live testing procedures using hot-swap methodologies that maintain operational continuity throughout testing. Our redundant system testing validates N+1 configurations, automatic transfer switch operation, and UPS integration without disrupting critical infrastructure operations, ensuring business continuity whilst achieving complete validation.

### What comprehensive documentation is provided after load bank testing completion?

Complete testing packages include detailed test certificates with comprehensive performance analysis, Australian electrical standards compliance documentation, power quality analysis reports with harmonic measurements to AS/NZS 61000.3.6 standards, performance trending data for predictive maintenance, maintenance scheduling recommendations, and optimization insights delivering improved system efficiency.

### How quickly can emergency load bank testing be deployed across Australia?

We provide 24/7 emergency response with 4-6 hour deployment across Sydney and Melbourne metropolitan areas, 8-12 hours for regional Australia locations. Mobile load bank units from 500kW to 2MW capacity ensure rapid testing capability for urgent commissioning requirements or critical system failure investigation.

### What testing capabilities do you provide for data centre Tier certification?

Tier III/IV certification testing includes 99.99% uptime validation protocols, redundant power system testing with N+1 configuration validation, automatic transfer switch performance verification, UPS integration performance testing, hot-swap testing for redundant system components, and comprehensive performance documentation meeting international data centre reliability standards.

### How does load bank testing integrate with generator commissioning services?

Load bank testing provides essential generator performance validation during commissioning, verifying power output capability, voltage regulation performance, frequency stability, and power quality across all load ranges. This integrated approach ensures complete power generation system validation with comprehensive documentation supporting warranty requirements and operational reliability.

### What safety protocols are followed for mining industry explosive atmosphere testing?

Our mining industry testing utilises ATEX/IECEx certified equipment specifically designed for explosive atmosphere operations. All technicians hold specialized mining industry certifications, testing procedures follow WorkSafe compliance protocols, and comprehensive safety documentation ensures complete regulatory compliance throughout all testing operations.
