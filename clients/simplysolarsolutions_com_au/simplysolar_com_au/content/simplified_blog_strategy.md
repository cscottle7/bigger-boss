## Blog Strategy Philosophy

### Quality Over Quantity Approach

**Strategic Rationale:**
Research shows that Australian solar customers spend **3-12 months** in the research phase, requiring in-depth, educational content rather than frequent surface-level posts. The simplified approach enables comprehensive research foundation, iterative quality improvement, and customer journey alignment while reducing content creation overhead.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Research-Backed Content**: Every post supported by Phase 1-3 research findings
2. **Evergreen Value**: Content remains relevant and valuable over extended periods  
3. **Customer Journey Focus**: Posts aligned with specific journey stages and persona needs
4. **Local Authority Building**: Content reinforces area-based expertise and community presence
5. **Conversion Integration**: Natural progression from education to consultation requests

### Competitive Differentiation Strategy

**Market Analysis Insights:**
- **Solargain**: Daily posting creating content overload and reduced engagement
- **SolarHub**: Weekly posts with inconsistent themes and limited depth  
- **Solahart**: Multiple weekly posts lacking strategic coherence

**Simply Solar Differentiation:**
- **Strategic Focus**: Monthly themes creating topic authority and expertise demonstration
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Thorough exploration of topics rather than surface-level treatment
- **Local Integration**: Geographic relevance embedded throughout content strategy
- **Customer Journey Alignment**: Content specifically designed for journey stage progression
