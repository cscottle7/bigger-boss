With data accuracy being crucial for informed business decisions and a single erroneous data point capable of creating system-wide disruption, this SOP implements multi-layered verification methodologies that ensure 99.5% data accuracy while maintaining operational efficiency and supporting zero-tolerance anti-hallucination objectives.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to all business information verification activities, including:
- Client data collection, validation, and maintenance processes
- Market research data verification and source validation
- Financial and performance data accuracy confirmation
- Competitive intelligence information verification
- Third-party data integration and quality assurance
- Automated data validation processes and manual verification protocols

## 3.0 Definitions

* **Data Verification:** Process of confirming that collected, input, or processed data is valid and contains no errors throughout the entire process
* **Data Validation:** Process of ensuring data is fit for use by checking against predetermined rules, constraints, and quality standards

   - Confirm source identity through official channels and contact verification
   - Check website authenticity using domain registration and security certificates
   - Verify author credentials and expertise in relevant subject areas
   - Cross-reference source claims with independent verification where possible

2. **Publication Verification:**
   - Confirm publication dates and version control for documents
   - Verify circulation, readership, or citation metrics for publications
   - Check editorial policies and peer review processes for academic sources
   - Document any source limitations or potential bias factors

#### **Step 2: Comprehensive Attribution Framework**
Maintain detailed documentation for all verified business information:

1. **Attribution Documentation Requirements:**
   - Record complete source citation including URL, publication details, and access date
   - Document specific page numbers, sections, or data tables referenced
   - Include contact information for human sources when appropriate and permitted
   - Note verification methodology and confidence level assigned

2. **Audit Trail Maintenance:**
   - Maintain chronological record of all verification activities
   - Document changes, updates, and corrections with timestamps
   - Track verification reviewer identity and qualification levels
   - Preserve original source materials and verification documentation

### 4.4 Procedure: Business Data Quality Control
