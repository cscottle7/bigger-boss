## 1.0 Purpose

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) establishes systematic methodologies for adapting content across multiple digital channels within the Autonomous Agentic Marketing System. With 30% of brands considering their multi-channel approach very successful in 2024 (up from 17% in 2023) and omnichannel strategies boosting incremental store visits by 80%, this SOP implements API-driven, customer-centric approaches that ensure consistent brand experience while optimising content for platform-specific audience behaviours and technical requirements.

## 2.0 Scope

This SOP applies to all multi-channel content adaptation activities, including:
- Content repurposing across digital platforms and channels
- Platform-specific content optimisation and formatting
- Omnichannel customer experience design and implementation
- Automated content distribution and syndication processes
- Cross-platform performance tracking and optimisation
- API-driven content management and delivery systems
