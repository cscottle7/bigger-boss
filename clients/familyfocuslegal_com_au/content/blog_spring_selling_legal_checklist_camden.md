## Introduction

Spring has arrived in Camden, and with it comes the peak property selling season. As Camden's growth continues with new developments in Oran Park, Gregory Hills, and the established areas of Camden South and Narellan, spring presents the optimal window for property vendors looking to maximise their sale price and attract serious buyers.

However, selling property in NSW involves significant legal obligations and compliance requirements that can feel overwhelming, particularly if you're selling for the first time or unfamiliar with the recent changes to conveyancing law. Understanding your legal responsibilities before listing your Camden property protects you from costly mistakes, ensures a smooth transaction, and minimises the risk of disputes with buyers.

This comprehensive legal checklist guides Camden property vendors through the four critical areas of spring property selling: preparing a legally compliant contract of sale, meeting your disclosure requirements, choosing between auction and private treaty sale methods, and navigating the settlement process successfully.

## 1. Preparing the Contract of Sale

### Why You Can't Sell Without a Contract

Here's something that surprises many Camden vendors: **you cannot legally advertise your property for sale until you have a properly prepared contract of sale**. This isn't just best practice—it's the law in NSW.

Advertising a residential property without a contract of sale is an offence that can result in fines. This requirement ensures buyers have access to essential property information before making purchase decisions and protects the integrity of the NSW property market.

### Essential Components of Your Contract

Your contract of sale must include specific documents, often called "prescribed documents" under NSW conveyancing law. These documents provide buyers with comprehensive information about your Camden property, allowing them to make informed purchase decisions.

#### 1. Title Documents

**Certificate of Title or Title Register**

This document proves you legally own the property you're selling. For Camden properties, the title confirms:
- Your registered ownership
- The property's legal description and boundaries
- Any mortgages, caveats, or other interests registered against the title
- Easements (rights others have to use part of your property)
- Covenants or restrictions affecting land use

Your conveyancing solicitor will obtain a current title search from NSW Land Registry Services, ensuring the information is up-to-date when contracts are exchanged.

**Deposited Plan or Strata Plan**

This diagram from the Land Registry shows:
- Your property's boundaries and dimensions
- Lot and section numbers
- Relationship to neighbouring properties
- For strata properties: your unit boundaries and common property areas

#### 2. Council Documents

**Section 10.7 Planning Certificate (formerly Section 149 Certificate)**

Issued by Camden Council, this critical document discloses:

**Planning and Zoning Information:**
- Current zoning (residential, commercial, rural, etc.)
- Planning controls affecting your property
- Height restrictions and floor space ratio limits
- Heritage listings or conservation areas

**Environmental Factors:**
- Bushfire-prone land classification
- Flood-prone land designation
- Coastal hazard areas
- Contaminated land records

**Development and Infrastructure:**
- Outstanding rates or charges
- Approved development applications
- Proposed road widening or resumptions
- Contributions plans affecting the property

For Camden vendors, the Planning Certificate is particularly important given the area's rapid development. Buyers want to understand how future development in Gregory Hills, Oran Park, and surrounding growth areas might affect their purchase.

**Drainage Diagram**

This diagram shows the council sewer line location and how your property connects to the public sewer system. The drainage diagram identifies:
- Sewer main locations
- Your property's connection point
- Any easements for drainage purposes
- Council's maintenance responsibilities vs yours

#### 3. Additional Required Documents

**Documents Creating Easements or Covenants**

If your title shows easements, rights of way, or restrictive covenants, you must provide the original documents creating these interests. Common examples in Camden include:
- Utility easements for electricity, water, or telecommunications
- Access easements for neighbouring properties
- Building restrictions protecting views or privacy
- Heritage covenants on older Camden properties

**Building and Pest Inspection Reports (Not Mandatory but Recommended)**

While not legally required in NSW, many Camden vendors obtain building and pest inspection reports before listing. Providing these reports:
- Builds buyer confidence
- Demonstrates transparency
- Reduces negotiation over defects
- Speeds up the sale process

### Special Requirements for Camden Properties

#### Swimming Pools and Spas

If your Camden property has a swimming pool or spa, you must provide:

**Valid Certificate of Compliance or Certificate of Non-Compliance**

This certificate confirms your pool meets current NSW pool safety standards, including:
- Compliant pool fencing and barriers
- Self-closing and self-latching gates
- Proper pool fence height (minimum 1.2 metres)
- No climbable objects near fencing
- CPR signage displayed

**Pool Registration Evidence**

All NSW swimming pools must be registered with the NSW Government. Your contract must include evidence that your pool is registered.

Camden properties with pools built before current safety standards may require upgrades before sale. A Certificate of Non-Compliance allows you to sell, but the buyer receives a 90-day period to bring the pool into compliance after settlement.

**Action Step:** If your Camden property has a pool, arrange a pool safety inspection at least 6-8 weeks before listing to allow time for any required upgrades.

#### Recent Building Work

If your Camden property includes residential building work completed in the last six years (extensions, renovations, new construction), you must provide:

**Home Building Compensation Insurance Certificate**

This insurance, required for building work over $20,000, protects buyers against:
- Incomplete building work if the builder becomes insolvent
- Defective work covered by statutory warranties
- Non-compliant work discovered within the warranty period

**Occupation Certificate or Complying Development Certificate**

Any structural building work requires approval. Your contract must show that:
- Proper approvals were obtained
- Work was completed in accordance with approvals
- An occupation certificate was issued (where required)

Many Camden properties in newer subdivisions like Oran Park and Gregory Hills have had landscape or structural work. Ensure you have all approval documentation before listing.

## 2. Disclosure Requirements

### Your Legal Duty to Disclose

NSW law requires vendors to disclose material facts that could influence a buyer's decision to purchase or the price they're willing to pay. This duty of disclosure protects buyers from purchasing properties with hidden issues and maintains fairness in the NSW property market.

Failing to disclose required information can result in:
- The buyer terminating the contract
- Compensation claims for losses
- Legal action for misrepresentation
- Damage to your reputation
- Potential criminal fraud charges in serious cases

### What You Must Disclose

#### Natural Disasters and Environmental Events

You must disclose if your Camden property has been subject to:

**Flooding from Natural Events (Last 5 Years)**

With parts of Camden and surrounding areas like Narellan and Elderslie affected by periodic flooding, disclosure of flood events is critical. You must disclose:
- Any flooding of the property in the last five years
- The extent and severity of flooding
- Damage caused by flooding
- Remediation work completed

**Bushfire Events (Last 5 Years)**

Given Camden's location near bushfire-prone areas, you must disclose:
- Any bushfire affecting the property
- Damage to structures or landscaping
- Bushfire preparation work or upgrades
- Insurance claims related to bushfire

#### Structural and Building Issues

**Known Defects**

You must disclose any defects you're aware of, including:
- Structural cracks or movement
- Roof leaks or damage
- Plumbing or drainage problems
- Electrical faults
- Pest damage (termites, borers)
- Asbestos-containing materials

The key test is whether you **knew or ought reasonably to have known** about the defect. If you noticed water stains on ceilings or cracks in walls, you cannot claim ignorance—you must disclose these issues.

**Unapproved Structures or Alterations**

Common examples in Camden properties include:
- Carports or pergolas without council approval
- Unauthorised additions or extensions
- Swimming pools without proper certification
- Granny flats without development consent
- Enclosed balconies or verandas

Unapproved structures can significantly affect property value because:
- Buyers may face council orders to remove or rectify them
- Insurance may not cover unapproved structures
- Future sale values can be impacted
- Council compliance orders can be expensive

**Action Step:** If you're unsure whether work on your Camden property was approved, request a history of development applications from Camden Council. This search reveals approved and rejected applications for your property address.

#### Neighbourhood Disputes and Legal Issues

**Ongoing Disputes with Neighbours**

You must disclose:
- Boundary disputes or encroachments
- Tree disputes (overhanging branches, root damage)
- Noise complaints or disputes
- Access disputes over shared driveways
- Any court proceedings involving the property

**Legal Notices and Orders**

Disclose any notices you've received from:
- Camden Council (building orders, compliance notices)
- NSW Government agencies
- Utilities (access requirements, upgrade notices)
- Heritage authorities

#### Future Development Impact

While you're not required to disclose proposed development in surrounding areas (that's the buyer's responsibility to investigate), you must disclose:
- Your knowledge of approved major developments adjacent to your property
- Proposed road widening affecting your land
- Compulsory acquisition notices
- Anything likely to materially affect property use or value

For Camden vendors, this is particularly relevant given significant infrastructure development including:
- Outer Sydney Orbital corridor planning
- Western Sydney Airport impacts
- Camden growth area development
- Road and rail infrastructure projects

### Material Facts: The Grey Area

Beyond specific disclosure requirements, you must disclose "material facts"—information that would influence a reasonable buyer's decision. Examples include:

- Previous use of the property for illegal activities (if you're aware)
- Serious crimes committed on the property (if widely known)
- Planned major infrastructure affecting amenity
- Significant issues with body corporate (for strata properties)

When in doubt about whether something requires disclosure, consult your Camden conveyancing solicitor. Non-disclosure can have serious legal consequences, while over-disclosure protects you from future claims.

## 3. Navigating Auctions vs. Private Treaty

### Understanding Your Sale Method Options

Spring is traditionally auction season in Sydney, with Camden increasingly seeing auction campaigns for quality properties in established areas and new subdivisions. However, auction isn't the only—or always the best—sale method for Camden vendors.

Let's examine both options to help you make an informed decision for your spring property campaign.

### Auction Sales

**How Auctions Work**

An auction is a public sale where your property is sold to the highest bidder on a set date. Your real estate agent or a professional auctioneer conducts the auction, typically at your property or online.

#### Advantages of Auction for Camden Vendors

**1. Creates Competitive Tension**

When multiple buyers compete in real-time bidding, emotional investment can drive prices above reserve. For desirable Camden properties in high-demand areas like Camden South or new estates in Gregory Hills, auctions can generate bidding wars that maximise sale prices.

**2. Fixed Timeframe**

Auctions provide certainty about timing. If you're buying another property or need to coordinate your sale with other plans, knowing your property will sell (or pass in) on a specific date is valuable.

**3. No Cooling-Off Period**

When the hammer falls, the contract becomes immediately binding with no cooling-off period. This eliminates the risk of buyers withdrawing during a cooling-off period, providing certainty to vendors.

**4. Strong Marketing Campaign**

Auction campaigns typically involve intensive marketing (professional photography, online advertising, print media, signage) that creates strong market awareness of your Camden property.

#### Disadvantages of Auction

**1. Higher Marketing Costs**

Auction campaigns typically cost $5,000-$15,000 for quality properties, compared to $2,000-$5,000 for private treaty campaigns. Vendors bear these costs regardless of whether the property sells.

**2. Public Exposure of Lack of Interest**

If your Camden property fails to attract bidders, the unsuccessful auction becomes public knowledge. This can weaken your negotiating position with buyers after the auction and require price reductions to generate interest.

**3. Reserve Price Pressure**

Setting the reserve price (the minimum you'll accept) requires careful judgment. Set it too high and the property passes in; set it too low and you risk selling below market value.

**4. No Cooling-Off Period for Buyers**

While this benefits vendors, it can deter some cautious buyers who want the security of a cooling-off period, potentially reducing your buyer pool.

### Private Treaty Sales

**How Private Treaty Works**

A private treaty sale involves setting an asking price (or price range) and negotiating with interested buyers until you accept an offer. Most Camden property sales occur via private treaty.

#### Advantages of Private Treaty

**1. Flexibility and Less Pressure**

You're not locked into a specific sale date. If your Camden property doesn't attract suitable offers immediately, you can continue marketing without the pressure of an unsuccessful auction.

**2. Lower Marketing Costs**

Private treaty campaigns typically cost less than auctions while still reaching your target buyer market through online portals, signage, and agent databases.

**3. Cooling-Off Period Provides Buyer Confidence**

In NSW, private treaty contracts include a 5-business-day cooling-off period (with 0.25% deposit forfeiture). This security encourages buyers to make offers, knowing they have time to arrange finance and conduct due diligence.

**4. Negotiation Privacy**

Negotiations occur privately between your agent and buyers. Unsuccessful negotiations don't become public knowledge, protecting your bargaining position.

**5. Price Guidance Flexibility**

You can market with a price range, "offers above," or "contact agent," allowing flexibility in how you present your Camden property to the market.

#### Disadvantages of Private Treaty

**1. Potentially Longer Sale Process**

Without a fixed auction date creating urgency, private treaty sales can take weeks or months. Camden's median days on market (43 days for houses) indicates the typical timeframe.

**2. Risk of Gazumping**

"Gazumping" occurs when a vendor accepts a better offer after accepting an earlier offer but before contracts are exchanged. While legal, it can damage relationships and reputations.

**3. Less Competitive Tension**

Buyers don't compete publicly, reducing the emotional pressure that can drive higher auction prices.

### Which Method Suits Your Camden Property?

Consider auction if your property:
- Is in high demand (quality family homes in established Camden areas)
- Has unique features attracting passionate buyers
- Is in a hot market with multiple buyers competing
- You can afford higher marketing costs
- You want certainty of sale timing

Consider private treaty if your property:
- Appeals to a specific niche market (requiring time to find the right buyer)
- Is in a slower market segment
- You want to minimise upfront marketing costs
- You prefer private negotiations over public exposure
- Flexibility in timing is important

**Camden Market Context (Spring 2025):**

Current market data shows Camden houses spending 43 days on market with annual capital growth of -5.19%, suggesting a moderating market where private treaty may provide more flexibility than auction pressure.

## 4. The Settlement Process

### Understanding Settlement Timeline

Once you accept an offer and exchange contracts, the settlement process begins. The standard settlement period in NSW is 42 days (six weeks), though buyers and vendors can negotiate different timeframes.

**Source:** [Thornton + King Lawyers - Property Settlement Process NSW](https://thorntonking.com.au/information-centre/a-guide-to-the-property-settlement-process-in-nsw) - 2025

### Your Obligations as Vendor Before Settlement

#### Week 1-2: Post-Exchange Requirements

**Notify Your Conveyancing Solicitor**

Immediately after exchanging contracts, provide your solicitor with:
- The signed contract of sale
- Details of your mortgage (for discharge preparation)
- Settlement preferences and instructions

**Arrange Mortgage Discharge**

If you have a mortgage on your Camden property, your solicitor will:
- Request payout figures from your lender
- Prepare discharge of mortgage documents
- Arrange for the discharge to occur at settlement

This process can take 7-14 days, so early action prevents settlement delays.

**Respond to Buyer's Requisitions**

The buyer's solicitor will raise "requisitions on title"—formal questions about your property. Common requisitions include:
- Confirmation of mortgage discharge arrangements
- Information about tenant occupation (if applicable)
- Clarification of easements or covenants
- Rates adjustment calculations

Your solicitor must respond promptly to keep settlement on track.

#### Week 3-4: Pre-Settlement Preparation

**Property Preparation**

You must ensure your Camden property is:
- **In the same condition as when contracts were exchanged** (except for reasonable wear and tear)
- **Vacant and ready for the buyer's possession** at settlement (unless contract specifies otherwise)
- **Clean and free of your belongings** (remove all personal items, rubbish)
- **With all included chattels present** (fixtures, fittings, appliances specified in contract)

**Service Disconnections and Transfers**

Arrange final readings and account closures for:
- Electricity
- Gas
- Water (final reading coordinated with settlement)
- Internet and telecommunications
- Council rates (adjusted at settlement)
- Strata levies if applicable (adjusted at settlement)

**Important:** Don't completely disconnect water and electricity until after settlement. The buyer may need utilities connected for their pre-settlement inspection.

**Notify Real Estate Agent**

Confirm settlement date and time with your agent so they can coordinate key handover after settlement.

#### Week 5-6: Final Settlement Preparation

**Pre-Settlement Inspection Cooperation**

The buyer is entitled to conduct a pre-settlement inspection (usually 1-2 days before settlement) to confirm:
- The property is in the agreed condition
- All included chattels are present
- No damage has occurred since contract exchange
- The property is vacant and ready for possession

Cooperate fully with this inspection to avoid settlement delays or disputes.

**Verify Settlement Figures**

Your solicitor will prepare settlement figures showing:
- Sale price
- Less: Deposit already paid
- Plus/Less: Rates, water, and other adjustments
- Less: Real estate agent commission
- Less: Solicitor's fees and disbursements
- Less: Mortgage payout
- Equals: Net proceeds you'll receive

Review these figures carefully several days before settlement to address any discrepancies.

**Arrange for Your Presence (if required)**

Most NSW settlements now occur electronically via PEXA (Property Exchange Australia), meaning your physical presence isn't required. However, you may need to sign documents in advance at your solicitor's office.

### Settlement Day

**Electronic Settlement Process**

Settlement in NSW occurs electronically through PEXA. Your solicitor, the buyer's solicitor, and any lenders involved all participate in a secure online settlement workspace where:

1. Final title documents are verified
2. Financial settlement statements are approved
3. Funds are transferred between parties
4. Mortgage discharges are registered
5. Title transfers to the buyer
6. Your solicitor releases keys to the buyer via the real estate agent

This electronic process typically occurs between 10am-2pm on settlement day.

**Post-Settlement Actions**

Immediately after settlement:
- Your solicitor notifies the real estate agent to release keys to the buyer
- The agent releases your deposit funds plus settlement proceeds (less commission)
- You receive confirmation that settlement is complete
- Title officially transfers to the buyer (registered within 1-2 days)

### Common Settlement Issues and How to Avoid Them

**Problem: Mortgage Discharge Delays**

**Prevention:** Instruct your solicitor to arrange discharge immediately after exchange, not in the final week before settlement.

**Problem: Property Not Vacant at Settlement**

**Prevention:** Plan your move-out date at least 2-3 days before settlement. Never assume you can negotiate extra time after settlement—the buyer is entitled to immediate possession.

**Problem: Chattels Missing or Damaged**

**Prevention:** The contract specifies included fixtures and fittings (dishwasher, air conditioning, light fittings, etc.). Double-check these items remain before the buyer's pre-settlement inspection.

**Problem: Settlement Figure Disputes**

**Prevention:** Review settlement statements as soon as your solicitor provides them (usually 7-10 days before settlement) so there's time to resolve discrepancies.
