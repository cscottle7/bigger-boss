## Service Overview

Luna Digital specialises in compliant Google Ads campaigns for medical practices and legal firms that generate qualified leads whilst adhering to strict professional advertising regulations. Our PPC strategies focus on high-intent searches that drive immediate practice growth through targeted, conversion-optimised campaigns.

We understand the complex regulatory requirements governing professional services advertising. Our Google Ads approach balances aggressive lead generation with AHPRA compliance for medical practices and Legal Professional Conduct Rules for law firms, ensuring campaigns drive results without regulatory risks.

Our professional services PPC delivers immediate visibility for priority services, captures high-intent searches during peak demand periods, and provides measurable ROI through sophisticated tracking and optimisation tailored to professional services requirements.

## How It Works: Medical Practices vs Legal Firms

### Medical Practice Google Ads
Medical practice PPC campaigns target patients actively searching for healthcare services, treatments, and practitioner expertise within your specialty areas. We create campaigns that capture urgent medical needs whilst maintaining AHPRA advertising compliance.

Our medical Google Ads focus on condition-specific searches, treatment option inquiries, and practitioner selection criteria that indicate high appointment booking intent. We develop ad copy that attracts patients without making prohibited therapeutic claims or outcome promises.

Medical PPC strategies include emergency service advertising, specialist referral targeting, and geographic campaign optimisation that captures local patients whilst respecting therapeutic goods advertising restrictions and professional medical standards.

### Legal Firm Google Ads
Legal firm PPC campaigns target potential clients searching for legal advice, representation, and court services within your practice areas. We create campaigns that capture urgent legal needs whilst adhering to professional conduct advertising requirements.

Our legal Google Ads focus on legal issue searches, court process inquiries, and specific legal service requests that indicate high consultation booking intent. We develop compliant ad copy that attracts clients without inappropriately soliciting or making unrealistic outcome promises.

Legal PPC strategies include crisis legal service advertising, competitor targeting within ethical boundaries, and practice area campaigns that capture qualified leads whilst maintaining professional standards and client confidentiality requirements.

## Compliance Considerations

### AHPRA Compliance in Medical Advertising
All medical practice Google Ads strictly adhere to AHPRA advertising guidelines, ensuring ad copy doesn't contain prohibited health claims, therapeutic outcome promises, or before/after imagery that breaches professional standards.

Our medical PPC compliance includes appropriate disclaimers in landing pages, cautionary statements about individual treatment outcomes, and keyword targeting that attracts patients without making therapeutic claims or guaranteeing health outcomes.

### Legal Professional Conduct Rules in PPC
Legal firm Google Ads must comply with professional conduct rules regarding appropriate advertising, client confidentiality, and professional standards. We ensure ad copy and landing pages meet advertising restrictions whilst maximising lead generation.

Our legal PPC compliance framework covers appropriate legal service advertising, client privacy protection, and ethical competitive strategies that build practice growth whilst maintaining professional integrity and conduct requirements.
