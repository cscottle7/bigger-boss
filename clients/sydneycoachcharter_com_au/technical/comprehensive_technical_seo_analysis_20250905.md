## Analysis Limitations & Assumptions

### Data Sources Used
- [x] **Direct Web Scraping**: 15 URLs successfully analyzed via WebFetch tool
- [x] **HTML Source Analysis**: Page titles, meta tags, H1/H2 structure extracted from live pages
- [x] **Content Structure Analysis**: Real heading hierarchy and content organization assessed
- [ ] **File Access**: Robots.txt, XML sitemaps not directly accessed in this analysis

### Current Date Context
**Analysis Date:** September 5, 2025  
**Date Validation:** 2025 dates are CURRENT (not future-dated)

### Assumptions Made
**CRITICAL**: Minimal assumptions made - analysis based on real data extraction:

1. **Assumption**: Some pages may have meta descriptions in HTML that weren't captured by WebFetch
   - **Reason**: WebFetch occasionally doesn't extract all meta elements
   - **Risk**: May have underestimated current meta description coverage
   - **Verification Needed**: Direct HTML source inspection for each page

### Missing Data & Limitations
**What could NOT be verified**:
- [ ] XML Sitemap presence and structure - Reason: Not directly accessed in WebFetch results
- [ ] Robots.txt configuration - Reason: Requires separate file access
- [ ] Server-side redirects and technical configuration - Reason: Limited to front-end analysis
- [ ] Page load speeds and Core Web Vitals - Reason: WebFetch doesn't provide performance metrics

### Confidence Levels
- **High Confidence** (Direct HTML Analysis): Page titles, H1/H2 tags, URL structure
- **Medium Confidence** (WebFetch Extraction): Meta descriptions, schema markup presence
- **Low Confidence** (Not Analyzed): Technical infrastructure, server configuration

### Self-Critique
**Potential Issues with This Analysis**:
- [x] Meta descriptions: Some pages may have meta descriptions not captured by WebFetch
- [x] Schema markup: Verified JSON-LD presence but detailed implementation needs manual review  
- [x] URL structures: Based on actual page URLs accessed and confirmed  
- [x] Content analysis: Based on real page content extraction, not assumptions

**Recommendations for Improved Accuracy**:
- [ ] Direct HTML source validation for all meta tag findings
- [ ] Manual schema markup validation using Google's Structured Data Testing Tool
- [ ] Technical infrastructure audit using dedicated SEO tools
- [ ] Performance analysis using Google PageSpeed Insights or similar tools
