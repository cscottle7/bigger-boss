## What is a solar inverter?

A solar inverter is the electronic component that converts direct current (DC) electricity generated by solar panels into alternating current (AC) electricity that can be used in your home. The inverter is often called the "heart" of your solar system because it enables the electricity to power your appliances and feed excess energy back to the grid.

### Types of solar inverters:
- String inverters: Most common, cost-effective option
- Microinverters: Panel-level optimization, better for shaded roofs
- Power optimizers: Hybrid approach combining benefits of both types
```

## How to Choose the Right Solar System Size

**Step 1: Calculate your energy usage**
Review 12 months of electricity bills to determine your average kWh consumption.

**Step 2: Assess your roof space**
Measure available north-facing roof area (minimum 20m² needed for 6.6kW system).

**Step 3: Consider future needs**
Account for electric vehicle charging or home expansion plans.

**Step 4: Match system size to usage**
- 3-4kW system: Small homes, low usage (10-15 kWh/day)
- 6.6kW system: Average homes, moderate usage (20-25 kWh/day)
- 10kW+ system: Large homes, high usage (30+ kWh/day)
