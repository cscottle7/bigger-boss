## 📁 Folder Structure Standards

### Primary Organization Principle
**Rule**: Organize by function, not by time or arbitrary categories

### Standard Client Folder Hierarchy
```
clients/
├── [client_domain]/                  # Client-specific folders
│   ├── README.md                     # Project navigation hub
│   ├── PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md           # Executive summary
│   ├── strategy/                     # Strategic planning
│   ├── research/                     # Market intelligence
│   ├── content/                      # Content strategy
│   ├── technical/                    # Technical analysis
│   ├── implementation/               # Execution management
│   ├── assets/                       # Supporting materials
│   └── archive/                      # Historical documents
├── CLIENT_FOLDER_TEMPLATE/           # Template structure
└── [client_domain_2]/               # Additional clients
```

### Mandatory Subfolders
Every client project **MUST** include these five core folders:
1. **`/strategy/`** - High-level strategic planning and analysis
2. **`/research/`** - Market research, competitive intelligence, audience analysis
3. **`/content/`** - Content strategy, style guides, content plans
4. **`/technical/`** - Technical audits, optimization recommendations, implementation guides
5. **`/implementation/`** - Project management, tracking, timelines, execution
